SCORN OF ALL TEMPORAL HONOUR. 247

CHAPTER XLI.

Scorn of all Temporal Honour.
God.

Y son, let it not hurt you
When you see others raised on high and
honoured,
While you are scorned and brought down low.
Lift up your heart to Me in heaven,
And man's scorn on the earth will never make you sad.

11.

The Soul.

Lord, we are in blindness,
Soon are we led away by vanity.

If 1 am just and look within,

Never has wrong been done to me by anything created,

That 1 should justly utter a complaint of Thee.

But, as I frequently and heavily have sinned against Thee,

All creation is in arms against me; and I merit it.

To me then the just due is scorn and shame,

And to Thee praise, honour, and glory.

And if Ι do not make myself ready for this—willingly to
be despised and left by all created things,

And really to seem nothing,

1 cannot inwardly attain a peaceful and a quiet mind,

Be lighted with the spiritual flame, nor fully bound to
Thee.
