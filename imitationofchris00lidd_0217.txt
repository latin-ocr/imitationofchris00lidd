SCORNING THE WORLD. 185

And yet in other wise Thou art more my servant than Ι
arn Thine.

Heaven and earth are ready to Thy hand,

Thou madest them to minister to man,

And they do always what Thou biddest;

And even this is little,

For Thou hast made the angels minister to him.

But it surpasses all

That Thou Thyself hast deigned to be the servant unto
man,

Saying Thou wouldst give Thyself to Him.

What shall Ι give Thee for Thy thousand kindnesses ’.Ρ
Would that Ι could serve Thee my life long,
Or even for one day show forth
A service that is worth the name.

Thou art worth any service,

Any honour and eternal praise.

Thou art indeed my Lord,

1 thy poor slave,

Bound with all my strength to serve Thee,
And never to grow weary in Thy praise.
This I wish ; this 1 live for.

All that is wanting in me

Condescend to give.

11.

11. Great the honour, great the g'ory won in serving Thee,

And to scorn all the world for Thee;

For they shall have great grace

Who willingly bow down unto Thy holy service.
They shall find sweet comfort of the Holy spirit,
They who for Thy love sake

Have thrown all carnal joy away.

They shall gain great liberty of mind
