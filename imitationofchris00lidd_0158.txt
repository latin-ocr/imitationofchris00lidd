128 THE OFFERING OF CHRIST.

To give yourself anew to Me ’.Ρ

What you give Me else I care not;

I do not ask your gifts, but you.

Just as it would not be enough for ¹you if you had all but
Me,

So it will not please Me, whate’er you give, if you give not
yourself.

Offer yourself to Me,

And give your whole sels for your G0d;

The offering will be taken.

Lo, Ι for you gave all Myself up to the Father‚

My body and My blood for food,

That I might be all yours,

You Mine—for ever,

But if you stand upon yourself, and do not freely give
yourself unto My will,

There is no full oblation,

Nor will there be full union between us.

So there must be before your every work the freest
offering of yourself into the hands of God,
If you would get freedom and the touch of God.
This is the reason why so few are really lightened and
made free-
They cannot wholly sacrifice themselves.

Stern is My word:
“ Unless a man giveth up all,
He cannot be a follower of Mine.’'
So, would you be one ’.Ρ
Osset yourself to Me, and all your beart
