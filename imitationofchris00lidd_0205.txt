Jub) 24.

‘THE LOVE OF GOD.

Going above myself for very fervour and for wonder.
Let me sing a song of love,

Let me follow my Beloved to the deep,
Let my soul faint in praise of Thee‚
Crying for love.

Let me love Thee

More than 1 love myself;

Let me not love myself

Except for Thee.

Let me love all in Thee—

Ι, who truly love Thee

As love‘s law bids me,

That takes its light from Thee.

Love is swift, sincere,

Pious, pleasant, and delightsome,
Brave, patient, faithful,

Careful, long-suffering, manly,

Never seeking its own g00d;

For where a man looks for himself,

He falls away from love.

CaresuI, humble, right,
Not weak‚ not light, aiming not at empty things,
Sober and chaste, firm and quiet,
With all the senses guarded well,
It is subject and obedient to superiors,
Lowly and scorned by its own eyes,
Pious and pleasing unto God,
Trusting and hoping ever in Him,
Even when He is not nigh 3
For without grief, one cannot live in love.
The man that is not ready to suffer all,
And stand to do the loved One's will,
15 not worthy to be called a lover.
