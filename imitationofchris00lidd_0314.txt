282 TWO VJEWS OF LIFE.

Likes to be seen abroad and try what many things are like,

Longs for recognition and to do what brings it praise and
admiration ;

Life touched by God cares not to look on what is new and
strange.

All that is new has sprung from old decay;

Nothing is new upon the earth; nothing can last.

Tlierefore it teaches man to rein the senses in,

To shun complacency and show,

To hide i11 humblencss what should be praised and won-
dered at,

In everything‚ in every branch of knowledge, to look for
useful fruit,

And what brings praise and honour unto G0d;

VVishcs no trumpeting of self or its own deeds;

God must be blessed in all His gifts‚ it says,

Who gives us all out of pure charity.

This life is as a lamp passing the light of earth, 3 special

gift of God,

And really a small sign to His elect, a pledge of their
eterna] safety.

It lifts man up from things of earth

To love the things of heaven,

Takes him from ssesh and leads him to the soul.

The more, then, that the life of man is crushed and
conquered,

The more the touch of God comes down on us ;

And daily, as God's visits come, the inner man grows in
his beauty once again like to the image of Godf‘

'⁸‘ Alluding to the saying of the Mystics, that man could get
back again to the beauty of God, in Whose likeness he was

made.
