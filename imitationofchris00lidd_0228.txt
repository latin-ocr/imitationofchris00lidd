φᾶ σου ΑᾹΟΝἝ.

Thy will be mine,

My will ever follow Thine, chiming in harmonv.
My likes, my dislikes one with Thine,

That Ι· may have no wish, no hate

Apart from Thine.

Grant me to die to everything on earth;
Here in the world, for Thee,
To live a life despised, unknown,
High above all my longings to set my rest in Thee,
And there to lull my heart to peace.
Thou art my heart's true peace, its only rest ;
Apart from Thee all is but harsh and restless.
And in this peace,
And for this peace,
In Thee (Ι mean), the one eternal good,
Ι will lie down and sleep.
Amen.

CHAPTER XVL ’
True Com-fort must be Souglzt in God Alone.

Aug. 26. LL that 1 can desire or think of to my comfort,
I look for it—not here,

Hereafter.
For had I in myself all the comforts that the world can

brin ,
And could I tiste of all delights that are,
Assuredly they could not last for long.

Thus, my soul, there is no true refreshment, no full
comfort, ¹
Save in God, Who takes the lowly up, and speaks con-
solingly unto the poor.
