6 HUMBLE THOUGHTS OF SELF.

Much talk contents it not,

But a good life will cool the burning os the mind ;

And a pure conscience

Brings us with confidence before our God.

The more you know, the better that you know it,

The sterner will thejudgment be, unless your lise be holy.

Then be not raised on high in pride for any skill or
knowledge of your own,

But rather fear for what has been entrusted to you.

11.
Jan. 3. If you think you know much and comprehend things
well,
Ressect that there is much you do not know.
Be not high-minded‚
But confess your ignorance.
Why would you put yourself before another?
Many may be found more skilled than you,
Many more learned in the law ;
But if you would learn something that will profit you,
Love to be all unknown, and lo be held as nothing.

The deepest lesson sor a man to learn is this, and the

most gainful too:

Truly to know—ay and to scorn himself.

Great wisdom is it, and. it makes a man far better,

To put no price upon himself,

And to think highly of his neighbour with a kindly mind.

For ifyou saw another sin some open sin,

Or do some grievous deed,

Think not the better of yourself for that.

How long can you stand straight? You cannot tell.

We all are frail ;

But this must be your thought—

“None is more frail than 1.”
