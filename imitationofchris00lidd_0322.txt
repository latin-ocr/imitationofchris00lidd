290 DESPAIR NOT.

He will our helpe1 be,

Our guide, our pioneer.

See. Stepping on before us goes our king,
To fight upo‘n our side

Follow like men,— ⁸

No sear of terrors now;

Let us be ready to die valiantly in war;

Let not the charge that we desert the Cross*
Be brought against our glory.

CHAPTER LVII.

When Man slzps into Faults, lze must not be too
much Cast Down.

God.
Dec 19· Y son,

Long suffering, lowliness in days of trouble, please
Me more
Than piety in days of happiness and wealth of consolation.†

Why does a trisse spoken against you make you sad Ρ
Had it been something more,
You ought not to have been so troubled.
But now: let it go by.
'Tis not the first; ’tis nothing new;
And, if you live long, ’twill not be the last.

Dec. 20. Oh you are man enough,
So long as nothing crosses you.

¹* Nec inferamus crimen gloriae nostrae
Ut fugiamusa cruce.
Cf. Maccabees, i. 9, 10, and see margin, which giVes the true
meaning of the above passage.
† He means, by consolation, sels-comfort3 that is, sels-
satisfaction.
