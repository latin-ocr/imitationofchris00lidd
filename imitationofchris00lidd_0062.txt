36 DUTJES OF A GOOD MAN.

Gird you like a man against the devil's villainies.
First bridle appetite,

And you will with greater ease tighten the rein on every
longing of the ssesh.
Never be wholly idle,

But read or write or pray or muse,

Or do some useful work for all.

Yet penance of the body must be used with care;
It is not to be laid on everyone.

Penance not laid on all
Must not be shown outside your cell.
It is your own, and safer done apart from men.
Yet you must not be slow to share the common penances,
And quick to ssy unto your own;
But, having wholly, faithfully fulfilled
All that is ordered and enjoined on you,
If tlzen you are at leisure,
Turn your thoughts upon yourself,
Just as your devotion would.

All cannot have one'practice;
One penance is for one, one for another,
And even different times have different penances.
Some please us best on holy days,
Some in the quiet week-days of our lives,
Some we want in times of trial,
Some in days of peace and rest.
Some things we love to think on in our hours of glooxr,
Some when we are joyful in the Lord.

But on high festivals we should renew
Each penance that is good,
And with greater zeal we should implore
Prayers from the saints,
