18 HOW TO GAJN PEACE.

111.

So we must watch and pray,

For sear our days go idly by.

If you may talk and it be best sor you,

Talk and build up the soul;

But evil habit, and carelessness about our path,

Make us neglect the doorway of the mouth.

Yet holy communing about the things of God leads us no
little way along the spiritual road,

And most of all when man meets man

Like to himself in heart and mind, like to himself—in God.

CHAPTER XI.

How to gain Pence and Earnestness upon our Way.

E might have peace, great peace,
If we would not load ourselves with others’ words
and works,
And with what concerns us not.
How can he be long at rest
Who meddles in another’s cares,
And looks for matters out of his own path,
And only now and then gathers his thoughts within him ’.Ρ

Blest are the simple-minded;
Peace in abundance shall be theirs.

Why were certain of the saints so good in life, so deep
in thought?
Because they tried to make themselves as dead to all the
longings of the world,
And thus with all the marrow of their hearts they clave to

God,
And could find time to muse upon themselves.
