16 OBEDIENCE AND SUBJECTJON.

Far safer standing in a lowly place
Than in a prelacy.

Many there are that live obedient lives; they must do

so—they love it not.

They meet their punishment5 they murmur over all,

And never will they get a soul at liberty,

Till for God's sake they bow themselves in lowliness with
all their hearts.

You may run here, you may run there,

And you will find no rest save in a lowly humbleness

Beneath the rule of him that is set over you;

And dreams of place and power and change of station

Have been false guides to more than one.

11.

True, everyone would like to act according to his will,
And rather turns to those who think with him.
But if God be in our midst,
Now and again we must give up our wills to win the
charms of peace.

Who is so wise
That he can know the universe in all its fulness?

Then listen readily unto another’s thought,
Trust not too deeply in your own.

’ Though your own wish be good,
Yet if for God's sake you will lay it down
To follow in another’s steps,
You will get greater good from that.
Ι have been osten told,
‘⁴ Safer to hear than to advise,
Safer to listen.''

Ay, it may happen, τοο,
That each man's wishes may be good enough3
