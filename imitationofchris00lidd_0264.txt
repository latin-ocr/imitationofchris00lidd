232 DENYING SELF.

You should be spu1red to higher ssights,
Or, at least, sigh and long for them.

I would it were thus with you, that you had come to
this,
To be no lover of yourself,
Stancling simply at the beck
Of Me and of the monk I placed as father over you.
Then you would please Me very much,
And all your life would pass in peace and joy.
You have much still to leave,
And if you do not give it all to Me,
You will not gain your boon.

Ι counsel you to buy of Me gold tried by fire
To make you rich; Ι mean, a heavenly wisdom‚
That stamps to nothing what is low.

Put earthly wisdom by,
And all complacency with men and self.

Lo, I have told you : buy the more valueless,*
Leaving the precious and the lofty among human things.
The wisdom from on high is very valueless and small,
Well nigh given over to forgetfulness;

Nor is he wise that thinks great things of self,
And tries to be made much of on the earth.
How many preach this with their lips ;—-

Far from it are their lives.
Yet 'tis the pearl of price, hidden from many.

That is, heavenly wisdom (satirically).
