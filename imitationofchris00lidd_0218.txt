Who step upon the narrow path for Thy name sake,
And put aside all worldly care.

O pleasant joyous servitude of God,
By which a man is truly rendered free and holy.
O sacred state of pious slavery,
That makest man equal to the angels,
Makest him a pleasant offering unto God,
A terror to the fiends,
A comfort to all faithful souls;
Oh service to be taken and for ever chosen‚
By which the greatest good is won,
And joy unending gained.

CHAPTER XI.

lee Heart’s Deszres are to be Scanned and Lz‘mz'led.

God.
Y son,
ι You have still much to learn

That yet you have not fully learnt.

The Soul.
What is it, Lord ⁴?

God.

To bend your wishes wholly to My will,
And not to be a lover of yourself,
But to be always wishing to work out My pleasure.

For longings often fire you, fiercely drive you on;
But think you whether you are moving
To serve My honour or your own advantage.
If Ι am in the work,
You shall be well content
With all that Ι ordain;
