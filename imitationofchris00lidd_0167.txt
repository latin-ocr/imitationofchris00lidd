WHAT IS NEEDEI). 137

Changed from one brightness to another,
The brightness of the unfathomable Deity,

They taste the Word of God made ssesh,
As it was from the beginning, and as it is eternally.

Vthn Ι remember marvels such as these,

Even every mental consolation,

Evcn every comfort of the soul,

Becomes a weariness and burden to me 3

For while I do not plainly see the Lord in glory,

I count as nothing all

That in the world 1 566 01 hear.

Thou art my witness, oh my God,

That no on'e thing can comfort me,

No creature give me rest.

Save Thee, my God, Whom Ι would contemplate eternally.

But this I may not do,

While 111 11115 mortal life Ι live ;

So I must make myself patient indeed,

And bow myself in all this longing unto Thee,

Thy saints, O Lord, who now rejoice with Thee, high in
the kingdom of the sky,

Waited the coming of Thy glory all their lives, trustfully,
very patiently.

That they believed in, I believe in too;

That they hoped for, Ι hope too ;

Whither they came,

Thither I trust that through Thy grace l shall come t00.

Till then Ι walk in saith, strengthened by the pattern set
by them.

For I shall still have holy books to comfort me and be a
mirror of my life ;

And, above all, Thy holiest body, my haven and my special
cure.
