TRUTH’S TEACHJNG. 7

CHAPTER III.

Τ rullt’s Teaclu'ng.

Jan. 6. APPY the man taught by the truth itself;

Not by the shapes and sounds that pass across his lise,
But by the very truth.

Our thoughts and senses osten lead us wrong;
They see one side alone.

What is the use of great disputes on what is hidden

and obscure ’ἓ

We shall not in the judgment day be judged because we
know them not.

But it is great unwisdom that we should neglect the gainful
and the needful things,

And turn our willing thoughts to what is strange and hurtful.

Eyes we have, and do not see.

Why slzould we care about scholastic terms ’.Ρ ‘¹'

ό]ιυι. 7. The man to whom the Word Eternal speaks
Is loosened from the bonds of many theorics;
For from one Word come all things,
And all things speak-—one Word.
This Word is the beginning.
It also speaks to us.
without this Word, no one can judge or think aright;
But he to whom all things are One,
And who to One brings all his questions‚†
² And in One sees all his answers‚
Steadfast-hearted will he be,
And rest at peace in God.

O God of truth‚
Make me one with Thee in eterna] love.

* De generibus et speciebus,
† Et omnia ad unum trahit, et omnia in uno videt.
