212 FOUR THINGS THAT BRING PEACE.

And he should be as glad to be the least, as any one would
be to be the greatest;

As restful arid content far down the table* as in the highest
seat;

Blest to be scorned, cast down,

No name, no glory his;

As pleased as if he were more honourable

And greater in the world than others.

For Thy good will, love of Thine honour should outweigh
it all,

Comfort and please him more

Than any good that is or can be given him.

CHAPTER XXIII.
Four T hz’ngs tlzat bring Peace.

God.
Y son,
1 Now will I teach you what the way is
To peace and perfect liberty.

The Soul.

Do, Lord, as Thou sayest;

Sweet to me to hear.
God.

Try, My son, to love your neighbour's will and not your own.
Choose to have less, not more.
Look ever sor the lowest place, subject to all.
Wish and pray
That God's will may be wholly done in you.
A man like this enters the land of peace and rest.

'The Soul.
Thy words, O God, are few,

²⁸¹ In novissimo loco.
