270 IN THE HANDS OF GOD.

Meet it is that even now Thy servant should endure some-
thing for Thee.

Father everlasting, reverend, the hour is coming, which
Thou didst know from all eternity‚ ⁷

In which for a short time Thy servant must faint out-
wardly‚

But ever inwardly live on to Thee ;

For a while must be despised,

Humbled, and fallen before the eyes of man,

Bruised by passion and by weariness,

That once again with Thee he may arise

In the dawn of the new light,

And be made bright in heaven.

O Holy Father,
This is Thy will, Thy pleasure,
And all Thou didst ordain is come to pass.
This is Thy kindness to Thy friend,—
Suffering and tribulation in the world for love of Thee,
Whenever and from whom Thou willest it.
without Thy counsel and Thy foresight‚
And without cause, nothing is done on earth.
It is good for me, O Lord‚ that Thou didst humble me,
That Ι may learn Thy ways of justice,
And throw aside all beart-elation and presumption.
Good for me that confusion has overspread my face,
That I may ask Thee to console me, and not men.
Ι have learnt from this to dread Thyjudgmcnts which Ι
cannot understand,
Thou that bruisest the righteous with the wicked,
But all with equity and justice.

Thanks be to Thee that Thou didst not spare my evil
ways,
But didst wear me down with bitter stripes‚
