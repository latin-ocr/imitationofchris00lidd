MUSJNG ON ΒΕΑ ΤΗ. 49

How dull, how hard the heart of man3
He muses only on the things that are,
And does not raise his eyes to what must come.
Therefore in every deed and thought you ought to act
As though you were to die to-day.
If your conscience were but good
You would not have much sear of death.
Better it were to guard against your sins
Than nurse this fcar.
If to-day you are not ready,
Will you be to-morrow ’.Ρ
And to—morrow is a day you must not count on;

How do you know that you will have the morrow for your
own?

What is the use of living long.
When our improvement is so slow ’.Ρ
But, ah, a long life does not always make us good;
It often only makes our guilt the greater.
Oh, would to God that in this world we had spent one day
well.

Many count up the years since first they turned to God,
But often there is little fruit to show of life made holier.

lf it be terrible to die,
Perhaps the living on and on will be more dangerous still.

Happy the man who ever holds before his eyes his hour
of death,
And every day makes himself ready for the end.
If you have ever seen a death,
Think that you too must cross by the same road,
And in the morning say,
‘⁴ Ι shall not see the eveniug of the day ; '⁹
And at the eventide,
“I dare not promise morning to mysclf.''
