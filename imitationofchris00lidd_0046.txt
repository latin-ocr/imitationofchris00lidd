20 “THE USES OF ADVERSJTW

That we were better, purer men when we set out towards
God,

Than when for many a year we had professed our love.

Our steps should daily further go, our love should
brighter burn ;
But now we think it a great thing

If any one can keep a spark of the first fire.

If at the first we would but be a little hard upon our sins,
Then we could master everything in aster days
With ease and cheerfulness of heart,
Hard is it to throw off our custom's chain,
And harder still to go against our wishes.
Yet if you vanquish not the slight and little sins,
When will you overcome the greater ones ’ἓ
Unlearn the evil habit,
Stand up against your bent at first,
Lest the little greater grow, and make things harder for
you still.
1 fancy you would be more eager on your heavenly path,
Did you but think what rest to your own life
What joy to others you would bring
By a firm hold upon yourself.

CHAPTER XII.
“ Τ he Uses of Adversity.”

SEFUL it is for man sometimes to meet trouble and
care opposing him,
Calling him back to his own heart,
That he may know himself a stranger in the land,
That he may place no hope in aught upon the earth.
