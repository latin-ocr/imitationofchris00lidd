132 FORBEAR NOT COMMUNION.

CHAPTER X.

Holy Commum'on should not nglzlly be Forborne.
The Voice of the Beloved.

FTEN you must run back unto the fount of grace
And holy pity,
To the fount of goodness and of perfect purity,
If you would be free of passion, cured of sin,
And be made stronger and more watchful to meet the
devil’s wiles and all temptations.

The enemy that knows the good and the great healing

power that lies within communion,

In every way, at every time, tries to hinder and draw back
faithful and pious souls.

For when some try to fit themselves for their communion,

They suffer worse attacks of Satan.

He is the evil spirit;

As says the book of Job,

“ He comes among the sons of God,”

That with his wonted wickedness he may disturb them,
making them too timid and perplexed.

Lessening their love, taking away their saith by his assaults.

It may be they will let communion go,

Or come but cool at heart.

But we must not think a whit about his cunning and
imaginations,
However base and horrible they be ;
But all his phantoms must be thrust back upon his head.
The wretched one is to be mocked and spurned,
And never for his insusts, nor for the storms he raises,
Are we to pass holy communion by.
