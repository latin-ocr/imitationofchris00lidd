Α God.
Aug. 29. Son,

Thus must you stand,
lf you would walk with Me,
Ready for suffering as for joy,

As willing to be poor and portionless
As to be full and rich.

The Soul.

Lord, willingly for Thee
All Thou wouldst send me will I suffen
And, as they come, from Thy hand will I take
Good and evil, sweet and bitter, gladness and sorrow,
Thanking Thee for all that comes.

But guard me from all sin,
And death-and hell shall never fright me.
Only, cast me not away for ever,
Blot me not from the book of life,
And then no stab of grief shall do me harm.

Jesus.
Aug. 30· Y son,

I came down from heaven to save you.
1 took your sad life on Me, not that I had to do it, but love
drew Me,
That you might learn to suffer,
And bear the ills of time without a murmur,
