WHAT IS NEEDED. 135

The body of his Redeemer in the sacrament,

And rather aim at praising and at honouring God

Than at secking any comfort for himself.

Oft as he thinks upon the mystery of Christ made ssesh,
And divells upon the passion piously,

So often he communicates in mystic wise,

And is refreshed by One he cannot see,

And his love burns anew.

But he who only makes him ready

When festal days are close at hand, or habit drives him.
Will be often unprepared.

e 11· Blest is the man

Who, celebrating or receivmg,
Offers himself a holocaust unto the Lord.

WVhen you celebrate, be neither slow nor fast,
But keep the good aud ordinary way
Of those with whom you live.
You are not there to trouble others or to weary them,
But to go on the plain road according to the practices of
those before us,
And to look rather to what helps the rest,
Than to your own devotion or your love.

Above All leings by the Faz'tlzfltl Soul.

WEETEST Lord Jesu,

How great Thy sweetness to the pious soul,
Banqueting with Thee at Thy feast,
Where none other food is laid before its lips
