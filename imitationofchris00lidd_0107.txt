Joy [Ν THE GOOD CONSCIENCE. 77

111.

Let naught be great or high or dear or pleasant to you,
Save it be simply God or of God.
Think all but vanity
That comes by way of comfort from created things.
The soul that loves its God
Scorns all things less than God ;
God only, everlasting and unmeasured,
Filling all the world,
The comfort of the soul, the heart's true Joy.

CHAPTER VI.

Joy in the Conscz‘ence that is Good.

GOOD man’s glory

Is the witness that his quiet conscience bears.
With a quiet conscience,
You will continually have joy.
lt can bear much,
And amid troubles is exceeding glad3
But the bad conscience
Is always restless and afraid.

Sweet will be your rest,
1f your heart blames you not.
Only be glad at heart,
NVhen some good deed is done.
The bad have no true joy,
Feel no true peace within ;
⁴⁰ There is no peace for the wicked, saith the Lord‚”
And if they say,
“We are at peace,
No evil shall come nigh us,
None will dare to hurt us‚”
