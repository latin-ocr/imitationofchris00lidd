CHAPTER XLVIII.

lee Eternal Day: tlze Straits of tlzz's our Life.
(A Rlzapsody of tlte Soztl.)

BLESSED mansion of the realms above,
Day of eternity so bright,
The day that night ne'er darkens,
On which high truth for ever sheds its gleam,
Day ever joyful, ever safe,
Never changing into darkness.
O that that day had burst on us, ’
And all the things of time had met their end.
Yet to the saints it shineth brilliant in its beauty,
But to the wanderers on earth only from far and through
a mirror.
Well know the citizens of heaven its joy,
The exiles, sons of Eve, groan o'er their long and bitter
waiting here.

The days of this our time are few and evil,
Full of sorrow and of troubles,
Where man by many a sin is stained,
By many a passion snared,
With many a sear convulsed,
With many a care constrained,
With many an anxious thought distresscd,
Folded in many vanities,
Girded with many errors,
Worn with toil, weighted with trial,
Weakened with luxury,
Tortured by want.

O when shall be the end of all these evils ’Β
And when shall I be free of wretched slavery to vice?
