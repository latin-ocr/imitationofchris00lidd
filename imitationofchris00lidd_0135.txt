CHAPTER Ι.

How Great the Reverence wz'tlz wlzz’ch Christ ¹
must be taken.

The Voice of the Learner.

May& I-IESE are Thy words, O Christ, Eternal Truth.
Yet notat one time given,

Nor yet in one place written ;

But as they are Thy words and true,

With thanks and saith all are to be received by me.
Thine are the words, and Thou didst send thern forth,
And they are my words too ;

For to my salvation Thou didst utter them.
Joyfully I take them from Thy lips,

To fix them closer in my heart.

Words of such pity rouse me,

F illed with Thy sweetness and Thy love.

But my own sins frighten me,

And my foul conscience thunders back at vme

Not to take hold of mysteries like these.

The sweetness of Thy words beckons me on,

The number of my vices weighs me down.

Thou biddest me with trustful heart come to Thee
If Ι would have any part with Thee;
And take the food of immortality
