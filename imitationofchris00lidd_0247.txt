CURJOSJTY. 215

CHAPTER XXIV.

Avoz'd α Curious Gaze mlo tlee Lz'ves of Others.

God.
5⁶9²· Y son,

Never be curious3
Carry not empty cares about with you.*
What is this or that to you ’.Ρ
Follow Μ6.
What is it to you, be your neighbour “this or that,”
Or if that other does and speaks ‘⁴ exactly as Ι say ” ‘?
Yon are not bound to answer for another,
You will have your own account to give.
Why then yourself entangle Ρ
Ι know all men,
And all beneath the sun Ι 566.
Ι know how 'tis with each,
All that he thinks,
All that he wishes,
And to what end his motives run.
Then all can be entrusted to My hand,
Yon—be restful; rest is good;
And let the busy man be busy as he will.
All he has done, all he has said, shall come upon him;
There is no cheating Me.
11.

Sept. 22· And have no care for a great name, mere shadow ;
Seek not familiar sriendship with the crowd,
Nor personal love with many.
This brings distraction,
And deep dark shadows in the heart.
I should be glad to speak My word to you,

*¹ That is, the troubles of other folk.
