DENYING SELF. 287

CHAPTER LVI.

gWe should Deny Onrselves (ind, by the Cross,
I ml'tate Christ.

Jesus. .

Dec. 16. h Y son,
The more you can go out of sels,
The more you can pass over into Me.
As sreedom from a lust for outer things
Brings inner peace,
So giving up yourself within
Joins you to God.

Ι want you to learn more—pure self-denial,
Resting in My will*
without a murmuring or complaining word.

Follow Me ;

Ι am the way, the truth ;
I am the life.

Without the way you cannot walk,
Without the truth you cannot know,
Without the life you cannot live.

Ι am the way you ought to follow,
The truth you ought to trust,

The life you ought to hope for.

l arn the way that cannot harm y0u‚†
The truth that cannot play you false,
The life that cannot end.

* In voluntate mea, “to my will,’' is quite a mistaken
rendering. The Mystic taught that perfect man and God are
one; cf. Book 1V., chap. i., “ I will hear what the Lord God
will say in me ; and cf. the teaehing of the treatisc everywhere.

† Ego sum via inviolabilis.
