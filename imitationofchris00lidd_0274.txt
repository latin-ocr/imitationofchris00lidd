242 A GOOD RULE IN EXTERNALS.

CHAPTER XXXVIII.

A Good Rule in Externals: Recourse to God in
Danger.

God.

Y son,

You should aim carefully at this,

In every place, action, or business of the world to be free
at heart and master of yourself.

All is to be 'neath you, not you ’neath it,
And you the lord and ruler of your actions,
No slave nor chattel;
But rather free and a true Hebrew,

Marching to the appointed lot and liberty of the sons of
God,

Who stand above the present world

And gaze on the eternal,

Looking on passing shows with the left eye, and with the
right on God.

The things of time draw them not on to cleave to them;

They rather draw these things into a goodly service,

As they were ordained of God, appointed by the Workman,

Who has left nothing vague in His creation.

If too in every chance n·

You stand not still and say, “It looks thus to me,''*

Nor look with the eye of ssesh on what you sec and hear,

But soon, whatever be the cause, enter with Moses to the
tabernacle and there take counsel of God,

Sometimes you will hear the heavenly answer,

And will go home learned in much that is and much that
is to be.

* stas non in apparentia externa.
