ΝΟ CONSOLATJON. 85

April 14. Great and long must be the conssict in a man

April 15.

Before he learns fully to win the battle o'er himself,

And draw his whole affection unto God.

When a man rests upon himself

He lightly slips to human comfort,

But Christ's true lover and the careful follower of the good
Does not fall back on consolation,

Nor does he seek deluding swectness such as this,

But asks that he may rather bear

Hasd labour and stern practices for Christ.

11.

Therefore when comfort of the spirit is given from God

to you,

Take it: be thankfu13

But know—it is a gift of God,

And not a merit of your own.

Be not puffed up ;

Do not rejoice nor emptily presume,

But be the humbler for the gift,

More careful and more timid in your actions ;

For the hour of consolation will go by and trial will follow
in its wake.

When comfort goes,

Do not at once despair, ι

But with humility and patience wait for the coming of the
heavenly One;

For God can give you greater comfort than before.

This is nothing new nor strange
To those who know God’s way ;
For in the lives of saints and seers of old
Often has it been like this—-
One comfort changing for another.
