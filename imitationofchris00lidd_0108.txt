78 Joy [Ν THE Gooz) CONSCIENCE.

Trust them not,

For on a sudden out will ssash the wrath of God.
Their acts shall be brought back to nothingness‚
And their thoughts shall fade away.

Glorying in trouble
Is not hard for one who loves;
For glorying thus means glorying in the CrosS.
Short-lived is the glory
Given or received of men,
And sadness ever follows in its train.

ra · The glory of the good lies in their consciences,

Not in men's lips.

From God and in God is the glory of the just;
Their joy is what is true.

He who sighs for the true eternal glory

Gives not a thought to that ostime,

And he who wants the fame of time,

Or does not heartily despise it,

Is proved to care but little for the fame of heaven.

A very quiet heart has he
Who cares for neither praise nor cursing.
If his conscience be but pure,
He is at peace and is content.
Praise makes you none the holier;
Cursing makes you none the worse.

What you are, you are,
God sees; you cannot be called greater.

If you but turn your thoughts to what you are when you

are by yourself,
You will not care what men say of you.

Man looks upon the face,
