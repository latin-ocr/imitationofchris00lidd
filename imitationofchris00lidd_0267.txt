THE TASTE OF σοι). 235

And what can give him pleasure
With whom the taste of Thee is not‘?

Oct. 16. But the world's philosophers and they that taste the
ssesh fail in Thy philosophy.
leere is many a vanity;
T here men find death.
But they who follow Thee in scorn of all the world, and

seek the death of ssesh,
Are known to be philosophers indeed,
Because they go from vanity to truth, from ssesh to soul.
God tastes sweet to them,
And all the good they find in His creation
They put down to the builder‘s praise.
Wide, wide apart the savour of Creator and created,*
As of eternity and time,
A candle and the uncreated bearn.

11.

Oct. 17. Ο blaze that shines for ever,
High above all the fires of earth,
Lighten in flashes from above,
Finding a way into the secret chambers of my heart.
Make pure,
Make glad,
Make clear, make quick my spirit and its powers
To cleave to Thee in wild excess of joy.
O when shall come that blest, that longed-for hour,
When Thou wilt seed me with Thy presence,
Be all in all to me ’.Ρ
Till ‘this be given to me my joy will not be full.

⁸* Dissimilis tamen et multum dissimilis sapor creatoris et

creaturae

AEternitatis et temporis
Lucis increatae et illuminatae.
