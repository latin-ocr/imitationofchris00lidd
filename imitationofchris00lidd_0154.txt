May 28· PONDERING, Ο Lord‚ Thy worthiness, my worthless-
ness,
1 shudder greatly,
And am confounded in myself.
For if I come not,
I shun life;
If I step in unworthily,
I meet with blame.
What shall 1 do, my God,

My helper and my counsellor in times of need ’.Ρ

Teach me the right way,
Put some short precept down before me,
Fitting the holy communion.
For it is good to know
How Ι ought loyally* and reverently to make my heart
ready for Thee,
Either to take Thy sacrament unto my health,
Or celebrate a sacrifice so great and so divine.
