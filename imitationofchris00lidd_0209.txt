HIDE POWER BENEATH HUMBLENESS. 177

And now and then into a blindness fall, almost past cure.

This falling of the proud, this ruin unto those who in their
solly lean upon themselves,

Put it before you as a warning to humility.

CHAPTER VII.

Hz‘de Power* beneatlz tlze Walclzful E ye of
Hmnbleness.

God.

Y son,

It is a good and a safe thing for you
To hide away your power to pray,*

And not to raise yourself too high,
Nor speak much of it, nor to weigh it much;
But rather to look down upon yourself,

And fear the gift of it to one unworthy as you are.

Not too closely must you cleave to this affection ;
Too soon it may be changed.
Think in the days of it
How weak ancl poor you are without it.

You do not get so very far upon the spiritual path
Because you have the gift of consolation ;

But if you humble self denyingly,

And patiently endure if it is taken away,

And grow not dull in earnestness of prayer,

Nor let your other usual works slip wholly by you,

But willingly do all that in you lies, all you know how
to do,
