274 WE ARE NOT WORTHK

I-eaving me desolate and helpless.
For could Ι weep tears like the sea,
1 should not even so be worthy of Thy comfort.

Sol am worthy of naught but to be scourged and punished,
Because Ι grievously and often have offended Thee,
And failed exceedingly in much.

Therefore, were the matter duly weighed,
Ι am not worth the smallest consolation.

But Thon, pitiful God and mercisul, who dost not wish
Thy works to pcrish,
To show the siches of Thy goodness towards the vessels
of Thy pity,
Even beyond all meriting ot mine,

Thou deignest to console Thy servant
Beyond the ways of man.
Thy comfort

Is not like chattering human wo rds.

What have Ι done, O Lord,

That Thou shouldst give me any consolation from on high ’.Ρ
Truly Ι cannot think of any good,

But Ι am prone to vice,

Slow in improvement.

’Tis true,

And Ι cannot deny it.

VVere I to say otherwise,

Thou wouldst stand against me,

And there would not be one to speak sor me.

What have I merited for all my sins,

But hell and everlasting fire Ῥ

Indeed 1 know that Ι am worthy of all scorn and mockery,
And ought not to be named among Thy pious souls.
Though it be hard for me to hear it,

¹⁸¹ Humanae confabulationes,
