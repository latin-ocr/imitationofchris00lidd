98 ROYAL PATHWAY OF THE HOLY CROSS.

To look down upon himself,

To love that others should look down on him,

Suffering adversity and loss,

And sighing for no prosperous days.

Look to yourself‚—

You will be able to do none of these;

But trusting in the Lord,

There shall be given you strength from heaven,

The world and flesh being brought low beneath your power.
Nor will you fear your enemy the devil,

If you be armed with saith, marked with the cross of Christ.

ι. Then take your station as Christ's good and faithful

servant,

To bear your Lord's Cross like a man,

The Cross of Him that out of love to you was crucified.

Be ready to endure much that will go against you,

And many things you will not like here in this life of misery;

For it will be with you, where'er you are.

Hide yourself where you will,

You will find it so indeed.

It must be so ;

There is no way to shun the grief and ills that troubles bring,

But by bearing with yourself.

Drink lovingly the chalice of the Lord,

If you would be His friend and have a part with Him.

Leave consolation unto God;

With such things let Him act as seems Him good.

But you, take up your station to withstand all woes, and
think them only as great comforts,

⁴‘ For the sufferings ofthis time are not worthy to compare''—

No, not though you alone could suffer all the sufferings in
the world—

“ With the glory in the days to come.''
