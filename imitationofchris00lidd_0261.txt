NEGLECT OF EVERY CREATURE. 229

For this great grace is wanted
To lift up the soul,
And hurry it beyond itself.

And, save the man be lifted up in spirit,
Freed from the world and wholly one with God,
All he knows,
And all he has,
Is of little weight.
He will long be little and lie low,
Who values aught as great except the one immeasurable
eternal good.
And all that is not God is nothing,
And must be held for nothing.

There is great differenee
Between the wisdom of a good bright soul
And the knowledge of a studious lettered cleric.
Far nobler is the teaching that drips down from the in-
fluence on high,
Than lealning painfully acquired by human wit.

Many are found who love a quiet life,
But do not try to practise what is needed for it.
It stays us much that we should take our stand
In wonders and in things we feel,
With so few passions killed.

I know not what it is,
Or by what spirit we are led,
And what we mean, who, as it seems, are called religiouS,
That we should spend such toil, such great anxiety, sor
things that pass and are of litt'e worth,
