THOUGHTS ΟΝ THE MJSERY OF MAN. 47

That by the love of all they saw they might not be drawn
down into the depths.

My brother, lose not heart, in going on upon your
spiritual path,
There still is time: you have an hour,
Why will you so put off your plans sor good ’ἒ
Rise and at once begin,
And say,
“Now is the time to act,
Now is the time to fight,

Now is the time to make myself a better man.'’

When you are in trouble and in woe,
Then is the time to win your crown;
Through fire and water you must pass,
Till you come out into a cooler land,
And, save you act with violence,

You will not crush your sin.

As long as we have with us this weak mortal frame,
Sinless we cannot be,

Nor can we live apart from weariness and pain.
We would 5ο gladly be at rest from all our trouble,
But, as by Sin we lost our sinless state,

We lost as well our blessedness.

So we must needs be patient,

Waiting for God's pity,

Till ‘⁴ this iniquity be overpast,

And our mortality be swallowed up by life.''

11.

Ο think of man’s weak state,
Ever howing down to sin.
To-day you shrive you,
To—morrow you will sin again the sin you have confessed.
