52 MUSJNG ΟΝ DEAIH.

Torn from the body unexpectedly.

Have you not ever and again heard people say,
⁶‘ Ah, he was pierced through with the sword,
Another drowned‚

Another killed by falling from a height,

One stiffened into death as he was eating,
Another in his play,

F ire took another,

Or the steel,

The plague,

The robbers on the road.”

And thus is death the end of all,

And human life is like a shadow swiftly passing by.
Who will regard you after death,

And who will pray for you ?

My darling, now do, now do all you can3
You know not when your death may come,
Nor do you know what is to follow for you, then.
While there is time,
Gather immortal riches,
Thinking of nothing but your safety,
Caring for nothing but what is of God.
Make friends unto yourself by honouring God’s saints,
Doing as they have done,
That, when you fail in this your lise,
They may receive you in the eternal resting-places.
Keep yoursclf as a stranger and pilgrim on the earth,
Keep your heart free and raise it up to God;
For here you have not an abiding city.
Thither every day let prayers and groans and tears ascend,
That after death your spirit may gain a happy passing to
the Lord. Amen.
