And to hope in Thee past all

Is Thy servant’s strongest solace.

To Thee my eyes are turned,

In Thee I trust, my God, Father of mereies.

11.

Bless and sanctify my soul with blessing from above,

That it may be Thy holy dwelling-place‚ the home of Thine-
eternal glory,

And that nothing may be found within the temple of Thy
condescension ³*

Offending Thy majestic gaze.

According to the greatness of Thy mercies look on me,

And hear the prayer of Thy poor servant so long an exile
in the region of death's shadow.

Guard, save Thy servant's soul amid the many dangers of
a life that soon decays,

And with Thy favouring inssuence to keep him company,
guide him along the road of peace unto his native
country of everlasting light.

Amen.
