THE SECRE ΤΕ OF GOD. 293

When then the enemy suggests these thoughts,
Or when some busy folk enquire,
Answer as the prophet did,
“ Thou art just, O Lord,
Thy judgments true.‘'
And yet again,
“ The judgments of the Lord are true,
Justified to themselves.’'

My judgments must be feared,
Not taken to pieces ;
They are not to be understood by human intellect.

l Dec. 23. Then do not ask,

Nor quarrel o’er the merits of the saints,

Which is holier than the other,

Or' which is greater in the realms of heaven.

Such things breed strifes and useless quarrels,

They nurse pride and vainglory, and envy and discussion
follow in their train ;

While one man proudly tries to exalt this saint,

And one another.

The wish to know all this, and track it out, brings you no
profit,

But rather makes saints sorry.

For I am not a God of quarrels, but of peace.

This peace lies rather in humility

Thau in exalting sels.

Dec. 24- Some are attracted with a zealous love and greate1
feeling to this saint or to that,
But this love is of man, and not of God.
1 am He that made all saints;
1 gave them My good influence,
1 showed them glory,
