DEEDS DONE IN CHARJTK 27

For then your good work is not ruined‚

Only improved.

No outward work avails, if charity be absent,

But all that in the name of charity is donc—

Never so little, never so trivial though it be—

Is wholly fruitful ;

Since God weighs more the means whereby you do your
work,

Than what you do.

Great is his work whose love is great,

Great is his work whose work is truly done,

Good is his deed

Who serves the common good, not his own will.

11.

We often call it charity,
And it is only longing of the ssesh3
For man's own bent,
And man's own will,
Man’s hope of gain,
Man’s love of ease,
Are rarely absent from his dceds.

He that has true and perfect charity
Seeks self in nothing;
But ever unto God alone desires the glory to be done.
He envies none,
Because he loves no joys of his own heart ;
Nor in himself would he rejoice,
But above every blessing longs to be at peace in God;
Attributing no good to any man,
He turns it all to Him,
From Whom as from a fount ssows everything,—
In Whom, as their last end, the saints take up their rest in joy.
