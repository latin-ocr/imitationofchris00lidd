CONFJDJNG IN CHRJSI: 149

CHAPTER XVI.

W'e ought to open our Necessitz'es to Christ and ask
His Favour.

The Voice of the Learner.

MOST sweet and loving Lord, Whom now Ι long with
holy thoughts to take to me,
Thou knowest how weak Ι am, the needs I suffer from,
The evils and the vices Ι lie bound in,
Weighed down how often, tempted, disturbed, befouled;
For remedy Ι come to Thee,
To Thee I pray for comfort and for help.
I speak to One that knows all things about me,
To Whom my inner life is wholly plain ;
He only can console and fully help me.
Thou knowest what good I need before all other goods,
How poor in character Ι am,
Asking for grace, Ι stand, imploring pity,
Naked, a beggar, before Thee.

11.

w . Refresh Thy hungry suppliant,

Kindle my coldness with the fire of love,

Throw light upon my blindness by the brightness of Thy
presence,

Turn all the things of earth to bitterness,

All heavy crosses into patience,

All low created things into oblivion and scorn.

Rouse up my heart to Thee in heaven,

Suffer me not to wander on the earth.

Now and for ever do Thou alone grow swect and sweeter
to me.
