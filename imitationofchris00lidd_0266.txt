234 THE TASTE OF σου.

Not for Jesus only,

But to look on Lazarus.

Therefore, the eye of motive must be cleansed, that it be
single and good,

And, beyond all that lies between, be levelled straight at
Me.

CHAPTER XXXIV.

To One wlzo loves Goel, there z‘s—z'n all, over all--
tlze Taste qf God.

O, my G0d‚ my all,
What wish Ι more? ,
What happier thing can I desire ’.Ρ
O sweet and tasteful word,
To him who loves the Word,
And not the world and all that is therein.

My God, my all,—
Enough for him that understands,——-
Sweet for the lover to say it over and again.
For in Thy presence all is sweet;
When Thou art gone,
All spoils.
Thou makest the heart quiet ; Thine is peace
And festal joy.
Thou makest it think well of all, praise Thee in a113
Nothing can please it long apart from Thee.
But if aught is to be sweet or pleasant,
Thy grace must be there too,
It must be seasoned with the seasoning of Thy wisdom.
To whom Thou tastest sweet,
What will not be sweet to him ’.Ρ
