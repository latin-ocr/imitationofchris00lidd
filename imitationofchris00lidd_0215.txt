SCORNING THE WORLD. 183

Nor be enlarged in heart,
But often be entangled and benarrowed.

Therefore ascribe no good unto yourself,
Nor virtue unto any man, 0

But all to God,
Without Whom man has nothing.

1 gave you all,
I will have all given back to Me.
And I shall ask for 11131116,-
And very strictly ask for them.
This is the truth
By which vainglory is defeated,
And if the grace of heaven and true charity have entered
once,
There shall be no envy,
And no narrowness of heart,
And no sels-love shall hold you.
For the charity of God shall conquer all,
And widen all the powers of the soul.

If you are really wise you will rejoice in Me alone ;
In Me only will you hope,

For 'none is good save God,
Who is above all to be praised, and in all to be blessed.

CHAPTER X,

How Sweet to Scorn tlze W‘orld and Live a
Slave to God.

Aug. 8. AND yet again, Lord, will I speak,

And will not hold my peace.
1 will say it in the ears of God,
My Lord, my King on high.
