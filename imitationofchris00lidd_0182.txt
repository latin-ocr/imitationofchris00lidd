152 DESJRE TO TAKE CHRIST.

The joyful eries that well from pious souls,

The burning love,

The mental raptures,

The flashes from above,

The heavenly visions,

With all the virtues and with all the praises from all
created things in heaven and earth, praises that
have been and that shall be sung for me and for
all others taken on my lips in prayer,

That Thou by all mayst worthily be praised,

And be for ever glorified.

11.

Ιιιζγ3. Accept my prayers, O Lord my God, and my desire to
praise Thee without end,

To bless Thee without measure

With blessings due to Thee

For Thine untold greatness in its many ways.

All this I give Thee, and would give Thee day by day, at
every moment of my time,

And call upon, and pray,

And with my loving prayers bid and invite all the spirits
of heaven and Thy faithful ones with me to give
Thee thanks and praises.

Let all the people praise Thee, tribes and languages,

And magnify Thy sweet and holy name,

In bright devotion and with jubilant cries.

And they who celebrate Thy lostiest sacrament with
reverence and pious thoughts, and with full saith
receive it,

May they too find with Thee kindness and pity,

And pray their suppliant prayers for me, a sinner.

And when they shall have gained the holy thoughts they
longed for, and the communion they would enjoy,
