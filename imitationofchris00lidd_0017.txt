TRANSLATOR‘S PREFACE.*

HERE is perhaps no name better known in
the world of books than that of Thomas
Kempis3 yet it would puzzle most people to tell
whether he lived in the thirteenth or fifteenth century,
whether he was monk or layman, whether he passed
a quiet or a stormy life, and what he did besides
writing the book which has made his name so
famous. The world of readers cares little for
biography that has no scandal in it3 and men pass
by simple lives to read about Saint Augustine's
immorality, Milton's domestic troubles, and Abelard's
tragedy of love. But God carries His work on,
though His workmen may be forgotten, and the
pen which won an immortality by eopylng the
Clzzcrck Music still “works miracles, turning bitter
waters into sweetness‚ every day.''

ὓ The Translator doesz not consider himself called upon
to discuss the question of the authorship. In whatever
way we decide it, it is tertain that we owe the book in its
present form to Thomas Haemmerlein.
