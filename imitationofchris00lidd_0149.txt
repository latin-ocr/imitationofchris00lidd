MANV GOOD THJN⁰GS ARE GJVEN. 119

And of a truth believe
That ,Thou art present here, both God and man.

May 23. Therefore Thou wouldst have me take Thee,
Making myself one with Thee in Thy love;
And thus Ι pray Thy mercy, and implore
That special grace be given me for this,
That I may wholly melt in Thee,
Flow over in my love,
And bring no outside comfort in to me any more.
For this, the highest and the worthiest sacrament,
Is safety of the soul and body,
The medicine to all the weakness of the spirit,
By which my faults are cured,
My passions curbed,
Temptations beaten down or weakened,
A greater grace poured in on me,
A growing virtue cherished,
Faith strengthened,
Hope hardened,
The ssame of charity lighted and blown.

11.

May 2⁴· For many blessings Thou hast promised, and still again
dost promise, in Thy sacrament, to Thy loved
ones who communicate with holy thoughts.

(My God, that takest up my soul,

Helpest my weakneSS,

And givest me all inner consolation.)

Much comfort Thou dost pour on them for many a tribu-
lation,

And from the depths of their deJection Thou dost raise them
to hope in Thee, their keeper,
