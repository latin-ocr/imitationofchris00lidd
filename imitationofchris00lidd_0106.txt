76 THOUGHTS ΟΝ OURSELVES.

Our deeds are often ill,

And our excuses worse.

Passion moves us ever and again,
And we think it zeal.

We blame the small mistakes of other men,
But for our greater sins—we pass thern by.

Ready enough to feel and ponder on all we suffer from
the world,

Thoughtless of all that others suffer at our hands.
If men would well and rightly muse on their own deeds,
No reason would there be for grievous judgment of another.

ri 2. The man who looks within,

Puts his anxiety for self before all other cares.

And he who diligently bends his thoughts upon himself,
Easily holds his tongue about the world.

Never will you live the inner life, never be holy,

Until you leave your neighbour’s matters all in peace,
And look particularly on yourself.

1f to yourself and to your God you wholly turn,

All that you see abroad will hardly move you.

Where are you when you are not present to yourself ’.Ρ
And after running everywhere,
What have you gained if negligent of self Ῥ
If you must have peace and really be at one,
You must put all else aside,
And keep yourself before your eyes;
Then you will gain much good,
If you can give yourself a holiday
From all the cares of time.
You will fail badly
Glancing at aught that savours of the world.
