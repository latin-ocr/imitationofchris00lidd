264 LIFE ETERNAL.

W illingly I ponder heavenly things.
If I love the world,

I am happy when the world is happy,

And sad at its adversities.
If l love the ssesh,

1 often conjure up its forms before me.

lf I love the spirit,

I love to muse on spiritual things.

Whate'er I love,

Of that Ι like to talk and hear,

And carry pictures of such things home with me.

But blessed is the man

Wh0, for Thy sake, O Lord, bids every creature pack,

Treats nature violently,

And in a spiritual fervour nails the lusts of ssesh upon a
cross

To offer Thee a prayer that shall be pure when the sky of
conscience is no longer clouded ;

And to be fit to join in angel hymns,

All earthly eries barred out, around him or within.

CHAPTER XLIX.

Desz're for Lzse Eternczl: all that is Promz'sed unio
tlzose that F z'glzt.

God.

Y son,
Since you feel descending from above a longing
for eternal bliss,
And you desire to leave the body·s resting-place,
To muse without the shadow of a change upon My
brightness.
