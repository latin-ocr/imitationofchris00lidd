202 BEARING INJURIES.

Yet, small or great,

Try hard to bear all quietly.

The more you set yourself to suffer,

The wiser is your act, the more your merit.
You will find all lighter to be borne,

Your mind and ways being with care prepared for it.

And say not,
“I cannot suffer this at that man’s hands; ”
“ Ι ought not to endure this sort of thing;'’
⁰⁶ He has done me a great wrong ; ’'
“He charges me with what I never dreamed of ;”
⁴‘ From another I would gladly take it,
Just as I ought.''
These are silly thoughts,
And look not to the valete of the suffering,
Nor think by Whom the suffering shall be crowned,
But rather weigh the actors in it,
And the insults offered us.

He is not the really patient man, who would only suffer
just as much as suits him, and from whom he
pleases.

The really patient man cares not from whom he suffers

(His prelate it may be,

His equal or inferior);

Cares nothing whether he be tried

By good and holy folk,

Or by the worthless and cantankerous;

But with indifference he takes from every creature’s hand
as heavy crosses, and as many crosses as may
come,

And all with gratitude to God, thinking them gain indeed*

For nothing, little though it be,

’⁸‘ Ingens lucrum.
