86 ΝΟ CONSOLA TJON.

Therefore one said when grace was with him,
“I said in my abundance,

I shall be never moved ; '’

But, when God's favour went,

He tells us what he felt ; and says,

“ Thou didst turn Thy face from me,

And Ι was troubled.’'

Yet even so, far from despairing,

He presses on his prayer to God, and says,

“ To Thee, O God, I will list up my voice,
And to my God list up my prayer.''

At last he brings the good back from his prayer,
And witnesses that he was heard, and says,

‘¹ God heard and pitied me,

He is become my Helper.'’

(And how P)

“ Turning my wailing into joy,

Surrounding me with gladness.”

If the great saints have found it thus,
We, weak and poor, must not despair,
If at one hour we burn,

And at another hour are c01d;
Because the Spirit ebbs and ssows

At the good pleasure of God's will,
And blessed Job has said,

‘⁴ At early dawn Thou comest to him,
And on a sudden provest him.''

But what, then, can Ι hope for,
And in what thing should I trust?
Even in God's great pity alone,
