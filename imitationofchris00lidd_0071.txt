THOUGHTS ΟΝ THE MJSERY OF MAN. 45

CHAPTER XXII.
T lzoztglzts on the Misery of Man.
WHERE'ER you are, where'er you turn, you are but

miserable,
Save when you turn to God.

Why so dismayed

When things succeed not with you as you dearly wish ’.Ρ

Who is there that has all things just to suit his. will ’.Ρ

Not Ι, not you,

Nor any living man.

No one without some grievous care and some distress
lives in the passing world,

King though he be or pope.

Who has the better lot ’.Ρ

The man who can bear anything for God.

It is the talk of poor weak-minded souls to say,
“See you that man ’.Ρ How good his life,
How rich, how great, how high, how strong.''
But turn your eyes to what is rich in heaven,
And you will see that all this trash of time is naught,
Quite unsafe, and only burdensome;
For it is never held apart from anxious thought and care.
Man’s happiness* does not consist
In the abundance of the things of time;
A little is enough for him.

Life on the earth is misery indeed.
The more a man longs for a higher life,
The greater is the bitterness of this.—
More clearly does he see, more plainly feel,
The want and the corruption of humanity.
