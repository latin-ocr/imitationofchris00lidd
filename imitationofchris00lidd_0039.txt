FLIGHT FROM VAIN HOPES. 13

He that is weak in spirit, and m a way slave to the ssesh,
leaning to things of sense,

Can hardly steal himself away from earthly longings,

And when he does heis but sad,

Easily angered if a man withstands him.

Yet if he gain his end,

At once his conscience rises to accuse him ;

He is cast down because he followed where his passions led,

Passions that aid him not to gain the longed-for rest.

111.

So by resisting passion,
Not by bowing to it like a slave,
The true heart's peace is found.
Theresore peace has no being in the heart of carnal man,
Given up to earthly things,
But in the burning spiritual soul.

CHAPTER VII.

Flzght from Vaz'n Hopes and Boastfzcl Prz'de.

AIN is he ’
Who puts his trust in man or in created things.

, Blush not to serve your neighbour for the love of Christ,

Nor blush at seeming needy in this world of time.

You must not stand upon yourself,
But rest your hope in God.
Do what you can,
And God will help you if your will be good.

You must not trust in knowledge of your own,
Or to the cleverness of any man that lives,
