SHUN PASSJNG A RASH SENTENCE. 25

In them his greater merit lies,

In them his virtue shows itself the clearer.

And it is nothing much,

If we be holy, if we burn in love, when there is no trouble
at the heart;

But if a man bears up when things are all against him,

There will be hope that he has made great steps upon the
road.

Jan. ³0- From great temptations some are guarded safely,
And in the petty troubles of the day osten cast down.
And why Ῥ

That they may be brought low,
And in great dangers never trust themselves,
Who in such nothings show how weak they are.

CHAPTER XIV.

Shun passing a Raslz Sentence upon Men.

Jan. 3¹· URN on yourself your eyes,
Beware ofjudging others' deeds.
We toil in vain in passing sentence upon men;
We often make mistakes,
Sin easily;
But if we judge ourselves and look within ourselves ue
always work with profit to the soul.

11.

Just as we have a thing at heart,
So do we osten judge of it.
We lose the power ofjudging true because we love a thing.
But if in our desire we only aim at God,
We shall not be so easily confounded “when our will’s
gainsaid.''
