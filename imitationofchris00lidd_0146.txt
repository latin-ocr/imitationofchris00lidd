116 GOOD TO COMMUNICATE OFTEN.

For Thou, Jesus, most pitiful, when preaching to the
crowds, and curing many a weakly one,

‚Didst say in olden time,

“I will not send them fasting to their homes,

For fear they faint upon the road.''

Deal in like manner then with me,

Thou that in the sacrament hast left Thyself

For the comfort of Thy saints.

Thou art the soul's sweet food,

And he that worthily has eaten Thee

Shares in the heritage of Thine eterna] glory.

Needs must Ι, who slip and sin so often,

Who faint and fail so soon,—

Needs must Ι, by many a shrift, by many a prayer, and by
the holy taking of Thy body, arouse myself, renew,
and purify and fire mysclf ⁴,

Lest‚ keeping far from Thee too long, I slip back from my
holy task.

For from the days of youth

The sense of man is prone to evil,

And, if the medicine of God comes not to help him,

Man soon slips into what is worse.

Therefore the holy sacrament

Draws man back from what is base,

And strengthens him in what is good.

For if I am so often lax and careless when I celebrate or
when Ι take,

What would it be if I took not the remedy, and did not
seek a help so great?

And though Ι am not every day fit or disposed to celebrate
it well,

Yet will I do my best, at seasonable times, to take the
sacred mysteries‚
