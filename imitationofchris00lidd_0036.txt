10 PRUDENCE IN WHAT WE HAVE TO DO.

Then good had bcen their studies and their books.
How many perish by vain learning in the world,
That care too little for the service of their God.
They vanish into shadows, while they meditate,—
Because they make their choice for greatness, not for
lowliness of mind.
Truly great is he,
Who has great charity.
Truly great is he,
Who in himself is small,
And holds as naught all heights of honour.
Truly wise is he,
Who deems all earthly things as dung,
That he may win the prize of Christ.
Truly learned too is he,

” Who does God’s will,

Letting his own will go.

CHAPTER IV.

Prudence in what we have to do.

E must not credit every word and every rising thought,
But with care and patience we must weigh a
matter as it is with God.

Oh, (it is sad) more readily we speak, more readily believe,
Ill of another rather than good3
So weak are we.
But good men do not lightly credit every teller ot a tale,
Because they know that human weakness is so prone to ill,
And apt enough to stumble through the tongue.

Great wisdom is it

Not to run hcadlong on in what we have to do,
