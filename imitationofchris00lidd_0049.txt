MEETING TEMPTA TJONS. 23

By ssight alone we cannot win,

But by longsuffering and true lowliness we get braver
than our foes.

He who only shuns thern outwardly
Will make but little way ;

Nay, sooner will they come again at him,
And he will feel them worse.

By slow degrees,
By patience and long waiting of the soul, God helping,
you will win
Better than by severity and your own restless ways.
Receive men's counsel often in the day of trial,
And deal not grievously with them that are in woe,
But pour consoling balm upon the wound,
As you would wish done even to you.

A wavering mind, a want of trust in God,
Begins the call to evil;

For, as a ship without a helm is driven· of the waves now
here, now there,
So the careless man is tried that lays aside his plan of life.

V·
Fire proves the iron,

And trial proves the good.
Osten we know not what our powers may be,
But trial shows us what we really are.

Yet must we keep a careful watch to meet the first
’ approach,
For then an enemy is vanquished with more ease ;
1f we will give no entrance at the gateway of the mind,
But meet him at his knock beyond the lintel of the door.
And one has said,
