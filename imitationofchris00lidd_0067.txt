LOVE OF SOLITUDE AND SJLEA'CE. 41

Why wish to see
What one must not have Ῥ
The world goes by, and all the lust sor it.
The wishes of our sensual nature draw us on to roam
abroad,
But when the hour is gone,
What can we carry back ’.Ρ
Α conscience heavy and a heart disturbed.

The merry visit often brings the sad return,
The merry watch kept up till late makes the morning dark.
So every sseshly joy comes with a smiling face,
But at the last it bites and kills.

What is there in the outer world that you find not in
your cell ’.Ρ ’
Here you have heaven and earth
And all that goes to make up life;
For from heaven and earth all things were made.

What can you see as you look round
That can remain sor long under the sun ’.Ρ
You think perhaps you will be satisfied;
You cannot gain this goal.
If you could see all things that are,
What would they be ’.Ρ “ The baseless fabric of a vision.'’*

Then list your eyes unto your God on high,
And pray against your sins and all you leave undone.
Throw vanity to vanity,
But, as for you, mind you the precepts of your God.
Go in and bar your door
And call upon your loved one, “Jesus, come to me.”
Stay in your cell with Him; ⁷

* Quid esset nisi visio vana ¹?
