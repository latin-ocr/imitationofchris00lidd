ROYAL PATHWAY OF THE HOLY CROSS. 97

The heavier are the crosses he will find;
For as his love grows greater, so there grows the punish-
ment—his exile on the earth.

111.

Yet though man be tried by manifold afflictions,

He has comfort wherewith to raise him ;

For from the very suffering of the Cross h'e feels great good
accrue to him.

He makes his will bow down unto himself,

And all the burden of his cares is turned to trust in
comfort from on high.

The more the flesh is worn by suffering,

The more the mind is strengthened by the grace within ;

And now and then the man becomes so strong (in love of
tribulation and adversity),

Longing to make his cross like His,

That he would not be free from pain and care.

The more acceptable to God he deems himself,

The worse the trials and the heavier the cares

That he can bear for Him.

This is not man’s virtue, but Christ’s kindness,

Which can do and which does so much in man’s frail
flesh,

That what by nature ssesh abhors and ssees from,

It gets to love and tries to gain through this fervent mental
fire.

'Tis not man‘s way to bear a cross,

To love a cross,

To beat the body and to keep it down in slavery‚

To flee from honours,

Willingly to bear contempt,
