DESIRE To TAKE CHRIST. 151

1 would receive Thee with the wildest longing and the
most fitting reverence

That any of Thy saints e’er felt or could have felt ;

And though Ι be unworthy to have all their holy thoughts,
Yet Ι offer all my heart's affection unto Thee,

As if I, I had in me all those pleasant burning longings.
All that pious men can think or wish,

All this with veneration and with inner fire Ι lay before
Thy feet.

I would keep nothing from Thee,

Freely and willingly as on an altar I sacrifice myself, my
all to Thee.

Lord God, my Maker and Redeemer, as Thy holy mother,

the glorious Virgin Mary, conceived and longed
for Thee,

When to the angel bringing her the tidings she meekly
and devoutly answered, ‘¹ Behold the handmaid oi
the Lord ; be it to me according to thy word ; ’'

So, with thoughts like this, with honour, praise, and
reverence like this, with gratitude and dignity and
love like this, with saith and hope and purity like
this, to-day Ι would receive Thee.

And as Thy blessed harbinger, John the Baptist, best of
saints, glad at Thy presence, exulted in the Holy
Spirit's joy,

While yet enclosed within his mother’s womb;

And, long time after, seeing Jesus walking among men,

Humbled himself, and with devout affection said,

“The bridegroom’s friend who stands and hears him,

Rejoices for the bridegroom's voice ; ''

So Ι would be afire with great, with holy longings,

And would present myself to Thee with all my heart.

Therefore Ι offer unto Thee, and lay before Thee,
