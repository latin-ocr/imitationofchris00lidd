(:2 WISH TO BETTER ALL OUR LIVES.

When man has come to this,
That he looks not for comfort to created things,
Then does he f. ·st begin truly to taste of God.
Then, too, will he be well content, let what will come, come ;
Then he will not rejoice for what is great,
Nor grieve for what is little,
Resting wholly, trustingly in G0d‚
His all-in-all‚
To Whom nothing ever dies,
Or fades,
But all things live to Him,
And at His nod without delay they serve Him.

Ever be mindful of the end;
“ Time that is lost never returns 3 '³
And never will you get to virtue
without anxious thought and care.
Once become cool,
You fall away ;
But, if you give yourself to fiery zeal,
You will be quite at peace,
And all your labour will seem lighter to you,
Because of God's touch* and the good you love.
A zealous, busy worker
IS prepared for everything.

It is a harder thing to stand against one’s faults and
passions,
Than to labour with the body till the sweat pours down.
He who does not shun small fausts,
Little by little slips into the greater.
You will be glad at eventide
1f you spend your day with profit.

’¹‘ Gratiam.
