88 GRA TI T UDE F OR GOD‘S K INDNE SS.

CHAPTER X.

Gratz‘tude for God's Kz'nd7ze83.*

HY seek for peace,
When you are born to toil ¹?
Give yourself up to patience, not to comfort;
To the bearing of your cross, and not to joy.

For who, of all men in the world, would not with willing-
ness receive comfort and spiritual joy
If he could always keep it?
For comfort in the spirit goes beyond
All earth’s delights and all the pleasures of the ssesh3
And all the pleasures of the world
Are vain or vile;
And only pleasures of the spirit good and sxveet,
The children of the virtues,
Poured down by God into pure souls.

But these comforts from on high, man cannot always have
them as he would,
Because the tempter’s hour may not be over.

And visits from on high find a great obstacle—
False freedom and great confidence in self.

God does well in giving kindly consolation,
But man does ill,
In that he does not put it down to God, and give Him
thanks for it.
And therefore gifts of grace cannot keep flowing in on us,
For we are thankless to the Author;
Nor do we pour them back unto the fount, the head of all.

⁴* Gratia.
