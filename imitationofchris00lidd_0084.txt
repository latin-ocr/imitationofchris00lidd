58 WISH TO BETTER ALL OUR LIVES.

11.

Once on a time a man oppressed with ngef,
A man that ever waveoed,
Hanging ‘twixt hope and fear,
Laid himself down in prayer
Before the altar in a church,
And thus he thought and said,
“Did I but know I should hold on unto the end.”

And, as he prayed‚ he heard a holy voice within him say,
“ If you knew it,

What would you d'o ’.Ρ

Do now just what you would resolve to do,
And then you will be safe.''

Forthwith, consoled and strengthened,

He gave himself unto the will of God,

And all his anxious wavering ceased.

No curious wish had he

To know what should befall him afterwards,
But he rather tried to find,

As he began and as he ended any action that was good,
The acceptable and perfect will of God.

“ Hope in the Lord, and do thou what is good;’'
Thus says the prophet,

⁴⁴ And dwell thou in the land,
And thou shalt feed upon its wealth.’'

There is a thing that keeps full many a man from
getting on,
And from an earnest bettering of his life,—
Dread* of the lions in the way, or of the toilsome fight ;
But it is those who try with manly heart to overcome
All that is harsh and grievous to them, ’

* Horror difficultatis.
