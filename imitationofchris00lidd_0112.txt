82 JESUS, OUR FAMJLJAR FRIEND.

11.

April 9· It is a matter of much art

To know the way to live with Him,

And to know how to keep Him shows great wisdom.
Be you peaceable and lowly,

And He will then be with you.

You may soon drive Him off and lose His grace,
If you will turn away unto the outer world.
Once you have driven Him off and lost Him,
Whom will you look for and go to as your friend ’.Ρ
Without a friend you cannot live in health;
And if He be not your friend above all others,
You will be so sad and desolate.

Thus you are acting as a fool

If you trust in any other or rejoice.

You had better choose

To have the whole world set against you,

Than Jesus angry.

Of all those that are dear to you,

Let Jesus be your special love.

111.

All may be loved for Him;
But Jesus for Himself.
He must alone be loved with an exceeding passion3
For He alone, before all other friends,
Is found both good and true.
ror Him and in Him friends and foes
Must all alike be dear to you,
And for all He is to be besought‚
That all may know and love Him.
Never desire excessive praise or love;
This is the attribute of God alone,
Who has no fellow.
