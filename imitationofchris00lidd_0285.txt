TRUST FEW.

In Thee, Lord, is the sasety of the just.
Blesscd be Thou, O Lord my God,
In all that happens unto us.

We are weak, unsteady,
We soon fail and change.
What man is he

253

That can so carefully and cautiously in all things guard

himself,
As not sometimes to meet with some-deceit or tangle ¹?
But he who trusts in Thee, O Lord,
And seeks Thee with a simple heart,
Falls not so easily.
And if he does *slip with some distress,
However closely he may get involved,
Soon shall he be drawn out
And comforted by Thee,

Because Thou wilt not leave for ever the man that hopes

in Thee.

Rare is the faithful friend,

Holding on in all a friend’s adversities.
Thou, Lord,

Thou art the only one,
Trustiest in all ;
None else beside Thee. none.

ο · O how wise that holy soul,

Who said,

“My mind is firmly founded,

Rooted in Christ.'’

If it were so with me,

No sear of man would easily disturb me,

Nor should the javelins of his words distress me.
