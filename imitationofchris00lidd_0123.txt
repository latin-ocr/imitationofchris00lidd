ROYAL PATHWAY OF THE HOLY CROSS. 93

Though what he does may be considered great;
But he should call himself a useless servant
If he would speak true.

So says the Book of Truth:
‘⁴ Having done all that is commanded you,

Say, ‘We are unprofitable servants.’ ''

Then will he be really poor and bare in spirit,
And with the prophet he can sing,
“I am alone and poor.’'
Yet none is richer than a man like this;
None is Stronger, none is more at liberty,
Who knows how to desert himself and all,
And bring himself down to the depthS.

CHAPTER XII.
The Royal Patlzway os the Holy Cross.

April 25. HIS seems to many a hard saying,
‘⁴ Deny thyself,

Take up thy cross,

And follow Jesus.''

But far harder will it be to hear that word at last,

‘⁴ Depart from me, ye cursed, to everlasting fire ; ''

For those who gladly hear the word given by the Cross,
and follow it,

They will not sear to hear

Eternal condemnation.

This sign—the Cross—shall be in heaven

When the Lord shall come to judge.

Then all the servants of the Cross, who lived as did the
Crucified,

shall come to Christ the Judge, quite trustful.
