Therefore be ready,

And live so

That death may never take you unawares.
Many die suddenly and unexpectedly‚

For “in an hour when you think not,
The Son of man will come.’'

And when that last hour does corne on you,
Then you will begin to feel so differently
Concerning all your life that has gone by;

And you will grieve and grieve that you were so remiss,
And that you left so much undone.

11.

How happy he, and prudent,
'Who tries in this life to be such a man
As he would be found in death.
Perfect scorn of all the world,
And burning longing to get on upon the virtuous path,
Love of sels-discipline, ι
And penitential work,
Quickness to listen,
And sels-sacrifice,
And readiness to bear whatever goes against him
For love of Christ,
Will make a man sure of a happy death.

You can do many a good deed in your days of health‚
But in your hour of weakness little.
Few by sickness are made better men,
And they who often go on pilgrimage
Are rarely made much holier men thereby.

Trust not in your friends and neighbours‚
And put not off the safety of your soul for days to be3
Men will forget you sooner than you think.
