OBEDIENCE UNTO OTHERS. 191

For, if the inward man be not a wilderness,*
The outer foe is sooner overcome.

But if you fight against the spirit

There is no foe so harsh, so harmful,

As you are to yourself ;

But you must wholly put on sels-contempt

If you would win against your ssesh and blood.
You love yourself too much as yet,

And are afraid to give yourself unto the will of others.

Aug. 19. But what fine thing is it IL

If you, mere dust and nothingness,

Submit yourself to man to serve your God ¹?
While I, the Almighty and the Highest,
That made the world from nothing,

I humbly was a servant unto man for γοα.

Ι became lowliest of the lowly,

Basest of the base,

For you to conquer pride by My humility.
Leam to obey, dust that you are ;

Learn to be lowly, earth and clay,

To bend beneath the feet of all,

To break your own will down,

To be a slave in all.

Be passionate against yourself,

Let not the tumour † live in you,

But show yourself so humble and so very little,
That all may walk above you,

And stamp upon you like street mire·

Aug. 20, Creature of emptiness, what can you moan about?
F oul sinner, where is your retort

²¹² That is, by the outer man gaining victories over it.
† That is, pride.
