250 VAIN KNOWLEDGE.

I give a clearer understanding to the little ones

Thau can be given by man.

To whom Ι speak, he soon is wise,

And makes much progress on the spirit’s way.

VVoe unto them who ask of men their curious questions,

Caring but little for the way of serving Me.

A time will be when Christ shall corne, the masters' Master
and the angels’ Lord,

To hear how all men read,—

I mean, to try the consciences of all.

Then will He search Jerusalem with lanterns,

And the secrets of the darkness shall be clear,

And wrangling tongues shall cease.

11.

Nov· 6. 1, even Ι, lift even in a ssash the simple mind
To understand more ways of the eternal truth
Than if a man had studied in the schools ten years.

I teach without the buzz of words,
VVithout the conssict of opinions,
without the pride of place‚*

without the battle-shout of arguments

I teaeh men to despise the earth, to loathe the things
before their eyes,
To look to the eternal,
To taste of the eternal,
To ssy from honours,
To suffer opposition,
To put all hope in Me,
To want nothing beyond Me,
And above all to love Me zealously.

* That is, Ι am not proud of being a Teaeher.
