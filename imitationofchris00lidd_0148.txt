LORD my God,
Go Thou before Thy servant with the blessing of
Thy sweetness,

That I may worthily and seriously come to Thy grand
sacrament.

Rouse my heart to Thee,

And pull me out from my dull sloth.

Visit me with Thy saving power, that in the spirit Ι may
taste Thy pleasantness,

Which in this sacrament lies hid, in all its fulncss‚ as water
in the spring.

Lighten my eyes, that they may see a mystery so great;

And strengthen me, to trust that mystery with an unfailing
saith.

For 'tis Thy doing,

And no human power3

Thy holy institution.

And no discovery of man.

For no man is found able in himselfto take and understand
these mysteries,

passing the keenness of an angel’s thought.

What then can Ι, unworthy sinner, dust and ashes as I am,

Trace out and take out of so deep a secret?

My Lord, I corne to Thee with simple heart. at Thy
command, with good firm saith, with hope and
reverence,
