JUDGMENT ΛΝΒ PUNJSHMENT OF slN. 53

CHAPTER XXIV.

The Judgment and the Pum'shment os Sin.

VER gaze upon the end,
And think how you will stand before the awful Judge,
WVhose eye sees all,
Who smiles not on your bribes,
Who takes not your excuses,
Judging with a judgment that is just.

O sinful one, foolish and wretched,

You who now and then are trembling at the face of angry
man,

What answer have you for your God Who knows your
evil deeds ?
WVhy not provide yourself with something on the Judgment

Day, when none will by another’s word be “
shielded, none excused;

But every man will be 3 burden to himself,

Heavy enough to bear ’.Ρ

Then will your present toil bear fruit,

Then will your tearful prayers be heard,

Your groans will reach His ear,

Your grief will cleanse you and will satisfy your God.

A patient man that when receiving wrong
Grieves more about another's evil thoughts
Than for the hurt unto himself,

Loving to pray for those who are opposing him,
Not slack in asking pardon of other men,
Readier for pity than for rage,

Often hard upon himself,

And trying all he can to bring the flesh below the soul,
He has 3 faithful medicine that will purify his life.
