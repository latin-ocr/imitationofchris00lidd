DESPAIR NOT. 291

You counsel others well ; your words can make them
strong as oak;

But when to your door ssows a sudden wave of trial,

You fail in strength and counsel.

Think how very frail you are;
You find it over and again in meeting little crosses.

Yet th‘ey are for your health‚
They and the like.

You know better,
Put it trom your heart3
And if it touches you,
Let it not sadden you, nor long enfold you.
Bear it with joy,
If not, at least with patience.
Though you do not care to hear of it, are angry at it,

Repress yourself,
Suffer no excessive word to pass your lips whereby the

little ones may stumble.

Soon will the wave of passion fall to rest,
And, when God's inssuenee returns, the inward smart will

turn to sweetness.

1 live, saith the Lord,
Ready to help and comfort you more than My wont,

If you trust Me and truly call upon Me.

Be more quiet then,
And gird yourself to stand still more.

All is not in vain,
If you find that you are often troubled, or tried grievously.

You are man—you are not God—
A thing of ssesh,

No anorel. ο
How Jould you always stay in the same state of virtue?

In this one of heaven‘s angels failed,
