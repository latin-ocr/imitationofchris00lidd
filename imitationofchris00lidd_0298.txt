266 LIFE ETERNAL.

You would be now free as the glorious sons of God,

And now the eternal home delights you, and heaven your
country, full of joy.

But that hour is not yet come;

There is some time yet;

A time of war, Ι mean, a time of tou, a time of proof.

Now you would be filled with what is best,

But you cannot get it in this way.*

I am He;

Wait for Me, saith the Lord, until My kingdom come.

You must be proved still on the earth,
And tried in much;
Comfort shall now and then be given you,
But fulness and abundance are not granted.
Be of good heart then: play the man
In action and in suffering nature's crosses.

Nov. 23· You must put the new man on you,
And change into another.
Often you must do the things you would not,
And leave the things you would.
What pleases others shall go well,
What pleases you shall not get on.
When others speak they shall be listened to,
What you say shall be held as nothing.
Others shall ask and get,
You shall ask and not succeed.
The names of others shall be loud upon men's lips,
Men shall be silent about you.
This or that business shall be put into another’s hands,
You shall be judged of use for nothing.
For all this nature will sometimes get sad,—

* That is, by being discontented.
