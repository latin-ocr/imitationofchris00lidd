184 SCORNJNG THE WORLD.

How many are Thy sweet ways to me,
That Thou hast hidden away for those that sear Thee.
But what art Thou to those that love Thce,
And serve Thee with the heart Ρ
The sweet reward they gain that gaze on Thee
cannot indeed be spoken of
And in this chiefly Thou dost show
The sweetness of Thy charity,
That, when I was not, Thou didst make me,
And when Ι wandered far from T hee
Thou didst bring me back to serve Thee,
And didst teach me to love Thee.

Aug. 9. Oh fount of everlasting love,
What shall Ι say of Thee?
How can Ι forget Thee
Since Thou hast deigned to think of me,
When Ι had wasted all away and died?
Past all my hope Thou showedst pity on Thy servant,
Past all desert of mine Thou didst give me Thy sriendship’s
touch.

What shall Ι give Thee for this favour ’.Ρ
. It is not given to all
To give up all, renounce the world,
And take monastic life on them.s
Is it a great thing to serve Thee,
Whom all creation is compelled to serve Ῥ
It ought not to seem great to me.
But tlzis is great and tlzz's is wonderful,
That Thou hast deigned to take to serve Thee
One so poor and so unworthy,
And to make me one with Thy bcloved ones.
See; all is Thine,
All that l have to serve Thee with,
