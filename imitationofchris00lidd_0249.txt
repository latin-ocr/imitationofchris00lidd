TRUE PEACE OF HEART. 217

Then will you be rarely and but little troubled.
But, never to feel any trouble,

Never to suffer pain of heart or body,

This belongs not to to-day ;

It is a state of everlasting rest.

11.

Think not, therefore, you have won it if you feel no
heavy weight ;
If you find no man against you,
Think not all is well;
Think not it is perfection,
If all goes according to your will;
And fancy not yourself some great one,
Or loved beyond all others,
If you enjoy devotion and sweet thoughts.
Not in such things is the true friend of virtue known;
Your progress and perfection are not found in these.

The Soul.
In what then, Lord ‘i’

Jesus.

In giving up yourself with all your heart unto God’s will.
Not seeking what is yours‚ little or great,
In time or in eternity,
But ever giving thanks with one set face
In happy days and when all things go wrong3
Weighing all in an equal balance.
If you are so brave and so long-suffering in hope,
That, when the inward comfort is withdrawn,
You can prepare your heart to suffer worse,
Boasting not of your goodness, saying not
That you ought not to suffer such as this,
