130 THE OFFERING OF OURSELVES.

What can Ι do for all my wrong but with humility
confess and mourn for it,

And without ceasing pray for intercession ἰ’
Hear me in mercy, my God,

When I stand and pray before Thee.

All my sins weigh on me heavily,

1 do not wish again to sin thern.

Ι grieve, I shall grieve for them all my life,
Ready for penance,

And to give satisfaction as Ι can,

Forgive me, O my God, forgive me them,
For Thy holy name,

And save the soul Thou hast redeemed with Thy precious
blood.

Ι commit me to Thy pity,
I yield me to Thy hand ;

Do with me as Thy goodness wills, not after mine iniquity

and evil ways.
111.

June 5. Ι offer to Thee all the good in me, slight and imperfect
though it be,
That Thou mayst make it puter, make it holier,
Welcome and take it to Thyself,
Ever turning it to better,
Leading me—useless, slothful, weakling though I be—
Unto a good and happy end.

I offer too to Thee w'
All holy wishes of the good,
All that my parents need,
Friends, brothers, sisters‚
All that are dear to me,

And all who for Thy sake have acted kindly either to me
or others ;
