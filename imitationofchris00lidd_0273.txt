RE SIGNA TI ΟΝ. 24 1

Some offer even the whole at first,

But afterwards, when beaten by temptation, return unto
“their own.'’

Thus they make very little way on the good road.

These will never get to the pure heart’s true freedom,

And to the favour of My close and pleasant friendship,

Save by perfect resignation and by a daily sacrifice first
made ;

Apart from which no union of delight can last.

111.
Oct. 26. I have often said to you,
And now again I say it,
Leave yourself,
Resign yourself ;

You shall enjoy great inward peace.
Give all for all,

Seek nothing for it,

Ask for nothing back;

You shall possess Me,

You shall be free in heart,

The darkness shall not tread you down.

Strive for this,

Pray for this,

Long for this,

That you be spoiled of all sels-seeking‚ a naked soul follow-

ing the naked soul of JesuS,
To die unto yourself
And live for ever unto Me.
Theu shall all vain phantoms fail,
All unfair disturbances,
All superfluous cares,
Immoderate sear shall ebb away,
Ill-ordered love shall die.
