114 GOD‘S GOODNESS AND CHARITK

That Thou, Lord God, my true God and yet man, art held
in the poor form

Of bread and flowing wine,
Eaten by him who takes Thee, and yet unconsumed.

Thou God of all the world, Thou that needest nothing,

didst will by this Thy sacrament to dwell in us;
Keep my heart and body pure, ’

That often and more often, with conscience clean and
joyful, Ι may celebrate Thy mysteries,

And to my lasting health receive

All that Thou didst appoint and institute for Thine especial
honour, and in memory of Thee for ever.

11.

Rejoice, my soul, give thanks to God, for such a noble
gift,
For such a special comfort
Left to thee in this vale of tears.

For every time that thou receivest this, and takest the body
of Christ,
Thou followest out the work of thy redemption‚

And thou art made to share in all the merits of our Lord.
His charity is never lessened,

And the great river of His offering never dried.

Therefore ever with renewing mind thou shouldst give
thyself to this;
And ponder on salvation’s mystery with careful thought ;

And it should seem as great, as new, as sweet to thee,
To celebrate, or hear the mass,

As if ‘to-day Christ had first come

Descending, man, into the Virgin’s womb,

As if to-day to save the world He hung upon the cross,
suffe-red and died.
