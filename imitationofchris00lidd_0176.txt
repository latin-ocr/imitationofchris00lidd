146 THE POWER TO PRAY.

Devotion and affection such as this,
Love and zeal 50 mighty,
Are often far from me.

11.

Be mercisul to me, O JesuS‚ sweet and kind and good,

And grant me, Thy poor suppliant‚ to feel but now and
then, in holy communion, some little heartselt
longing for Thy love.

My saith shall stronger grow,

My hope increase, because Thou art 50 good.

The ssame once kindled, and heavenly food once tasted,

My charity shall never fail.

Thy mercy in its power can give the kindness longed for,

Can visit me most graciously with fervour of the soul in
the day of Thy good pleasure.

For, though Ι burn not with the great desire

Of those especial souls that love Thee‚

Yet, if Thou wilt, I wish for that great burning longing,

Praying and sighing for a place among Thy fervid lovers,

And to be counted in their holy company.

CHAPTER XV.

This Power to Pray ’ᾗ is to be gained by Hmnbleness
and by Self-Sacrifice.

The Voice of the Beloved.

OU must seek earnestly the power to be devont,
Look for it anxiously, wait for it with trust,
Take it with thanks,
Keep it in humility,
VVork with it carefully, †

'¹‘ Gratia devotionis.
† Studiose curn ea opeari.
