A FREE MIND. 2 19

Due to the common curse of man, laid upon him for
punishment,

Which block the way before Thy servant's soul,

And keep it from the sreedom of the Spirit
When it would enter in.

111.

Ο God, my sweetness past all speech,
Turn to bitterness for me

All carnal comfort that draws me from the love of the
eternal,

And wickedly allures me to itself by showing me some
present charming blessing.

Let it not conquer me, my God,
Let it not conquer me,

My flesh and blood.

Let not the world and its brief glory cheat me;
Let not the devil and his cunning trip me up ;
Grant me bravery to stand,

Patience to bear,

Constancy to persevere.

For all worldly consolation

Give me the sweet ointment os Thy Spirit,
And for the love of ssesh love of Thy name.

See. Food and drink and raiment,
And all the rest that goes to stay the body for a time,
Are only burdens to the fervent spirit.
Such comforts may I use all moderately,

And not be netted by a love of them.
I may not cast all off,
For nature must be fed;

But Thy holy law forbids me to ask for more than Ι may
want, or for what pleases much.
