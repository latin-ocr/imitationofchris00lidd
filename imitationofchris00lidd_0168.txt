138 ’ WHAT Js NEEDED.

11.
Two things in this life above all 1 feel Ι need,
without which Ι could scarcely bear these days of misery;
Here, in the prison of the body pent,
Ι know it, Ι need two,—
Food, light.
Therefore Thou hast given me in my weakness

Thy holy body to refresh my mind and mortal frame;
Thou hast set up Thy word, a lantern for my feet.
Robbed of these two, I cannot live arig'it.

My soul's light is God’s word,

My bread of life—Thy sacrament.

And Ι may call these tables two, one here, one there,

Laid in the treasure-house of holy Church.

One is the table of the sacred altar,

Having the holy bread‚—the precious body of Christ ;

The other is the table of the law of heaven,

With its blest teaching,

Making me learned in the saith,

And leading me with steady hand up to the inner veil,
where the Holy of Holies lies.

111.

Thanks be to Thee, Lord jesu, Light of light eternal,
For the table of Thy holy teaching,
Thy table served to us by servants of Thy house,
Apostles, priests, and other learned men.
Thanks be to Thee, Maker, Redeemer of mankind,
That Thou, to show Thy charity to all the world,
Madest a great supper,
W herein before us for our food
Thou placedst, not the lamb, the type of Thee,
But Thine own holy body and Thy blood,
Making the army of the faithful joyful by Thy sacred feast,
