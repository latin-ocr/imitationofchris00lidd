THE SECRETS OF GOD. 295

Then silent be the wrangling of all sseshly animal men

about the state of saints ;

Men know not how to love aught but their own delight.

They take away and add just as they please,

Not as it pleases the everlasting truth.

In many there is ignorance,

And above all in those who, dimly enlightened,

Cannot love any with a perfect spiritual love.

Now they are greatly drawn by natural affection and by
human friendship to these men or to those,

And, as they find things here on earth,

So they think it is with things of heaven ;

But far, incomparably far,

Are their imperfect thoughts

, From the sights seen by those whose eyes are brightened

by the revelation from on high.

See then, My son, that you do not curiously handle the

things beyond your knowledge,

But rather think on this, make this your care,

That you be found there in God’s kingdom, though you be
but the least.

Even though a man should know who is the holier or the
greater there,

What would the knowledge profit him,

Unless this made him humbler before Me, and raised him
up unto the greater glory of My name ’.Ρ

Far more acceptable to God is he

Who thinks upon the greatness of his sins, the smallness
of his virtues,

How far he is away from the perfection of the saints,

Than he who talks about their greatness or their littleness.

Better to pray unto the saints with pious prayers and tears,
