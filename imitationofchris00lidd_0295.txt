THE ETERNAL ΒΑΚ 263

And, even as 1 pray, a crowd of fleshly things comes o’er
me.

Go not sar from me, O my God,
Turn not away in anger from Thy servant.
Flash forth Thy lightning, scatter thern,

Shoot out Thine arrows and confuse the foeman’s phantom
ranks.

Call home my senses unto Thee,

Make me forget all worldly things,

Let me quickly cast aside and spurn the wicked dreams.*
Help me, eternal Truth,

That no vanity may carry me away.

O come, celestial sweetness,

And from Thy face let all uncleanness fly.

Pardon me, forgive me, of Thy pity,
When in my prayer 1 think of other things but Thee.

For I confess the truth;
I am accustomed to be much distraeted,
Osten I am not
Where my body stands or sits,
But I arn rather there
Where I am borne upon the wings of thoughts.
Where my thoughts are, there am I,
And my thoughts are often
Where lies what I love.
That osten comes across my mind,
Which naturally pleases or from habit suits me;
Wherefore Thou the Truth didst plainly say,
‘⁴ Where your treasure is,
There will your heart be also.”
Is l love heaven,

* Phantasmata vitiorum.
