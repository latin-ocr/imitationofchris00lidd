102 TRUTH SPEAKS WITHIN US.

II.

Turn thee to this, my soul,
And shut the doorway of the senses ;
That thou mayst hear

The words of thy Lord God within thee.

Thus saith thy Beloved:
I am thy health,
Thy peace, thy life ;
Keep thee near me,
And thou shalt find thy rest.
Away with all these passing scenes,
And seek the everlasting;
For what are all the shows of time
But guides to lead men wrong ’ἓ

What can all creation help thee
If thou be left by the Creator ⁴?

Come down then and leave all ;

Give thyself back, faithful and pleasing‚
To thy Creator's hand,
To gain true bliss.

CHAPTER 11.

T ruth Speaks Wz'thz'n Us,· there is no
Dz'n of Words.
The Soul.

July 9· ‘⁸ PEAK, Lord; Thy servant heareth.”
I am Thy servant,
Give me understanding, that 1 may know Thy testi-
monies.
Incline mine heart to the words of Thy mouth,
And let Thy speech drop on me as the dew.''
