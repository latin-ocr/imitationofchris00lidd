34 DUTJES OF A GOOD MAN.

CHAPTER XIX.
lee Dutz‘es of a Good Man z'n a Brotherhood.

GOOD man's life in a monastic house should gleam
with every virtue,
That he may be, within, ο
What outwardly he seems to man to be.
And with good reason should his inner life
Be far more than we see outside ;
For He Who looks within our life is God,
WVhom above all we ought to reverence,
Walking beneath His gaze
As do the angels—pure.

With each fresh day we should renew the purpose set
before us,

And rouse ourselves to zeal,

As if to-day for the first time we came into our newer life;
And say,

‘⁴ Help me, Ο Lord my God, in this my purpose,

And in my holy service;

Grant me to-day to go on well,

For all I have yet done is naught.”

As our plans are, so is the road of our success,
And he that would succeed must needs work hard.

But if the man who maps 3 brave course out
Is often found to fail,
What will he do who plans but now and then,
Or plans but languidly Ῥ
In many a way we leave the plans we have laid down,

But every time we pass 3 holy practice by we feel some
loss.
