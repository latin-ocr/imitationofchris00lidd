HOW WE OUGHT TO WALK. 167

Have nothing,
And am nothing worth.

Thou only art the Just, the Good, the Holy,
The All-powerful,

Giving all, filling all,

Leaving only sinners empty.

Have thought upon Thy pity,

Fill my heart with inssuence from Thee,

Thou wouldst not that Thy work should be in vain.
How can I bear me in this life of misery,

Unless Thou strengthen me with pity and with favour ’.Ρ

Turn not Thy face from me ;
Delay not long Thy visitation ;
Take not Thy comfort all away,

Nor let my soul become a thirsty land to Thee.
Lord, teach me how to do Thy will,

And to walk worthily and humbly before Thee.
Thou art my wisdom; Thou dost really know me,

Thou knewest me before the world was made, or ever I
was born in it.

CHAPTER IV.

How we ought to walk in T rutlz and Lowliness
bqfore the Eyes of God.

God.
ΟΝ,
Walk in My sight in truth,
Look for Me always with a simple heart.
He that does this
ls sase from evil thoughts that come against him,
And truth shall make him free
