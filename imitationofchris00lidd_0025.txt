ΤΚΛ NSLA TOR ’S PREFA CE. xix

Are busied with the inner life.

Blest are they who penetrate within,

And more and more by daily use

Strive to prepare themselves

To take the heavenly mysteries.

And blest are they who try to give their time to God,
And shake them free from all the burden of the world.

So, all is vanity‚
Save loving God and serving Him alone-⁸⁰
