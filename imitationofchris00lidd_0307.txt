WE ARE NOT WORTHY. ‘275

Yet for truth sake I will bring up my sins against myself,
That I may the easier win Thy pity.

What shall Ι, guilty, say,

Fun of all confusion ¹?

1 have no lips to speak save this, save this alone,—

1 have sinned, Lord, I have sinned.

Pity me, pardon me,

Let me for a space bewail my pain

Before Ι pass into the shadowy land, shrouded with the
cloud of death.

What dost Thou first ask of one that is accused, a

wretched sinner,

Save that he be bruised and humbled for his sins ’.Ρ

The hope of pardon has its birth in true contrition and in
lowliness of heart ;

The troubled conscience is there brought to peace,

Lost favour is regained,

The man is saved from coming wrath‚

God and the penitent soul run and meet each other in a
holy kiss.

A humble sorrow for one's sins

Is a sacrifice that Thou wilt take, Ο Lord,

Of a far sweeter savour in Thy sight than smoke of incense.

This is the pleasant ointment Thou didst wish poured on
Thy sacred feet,

For Thou hast never scorned the humble and the contrite
heart.

There is the place of refuge from before the anger of the
enemy ;

There the soul is bettered and washed clean,

However pressed or stained elsewhere*
