142 PREPARA T I ON.

You come for sanctity to Me, to be made one with Me,
To take fresh favour from Me,

And ssash anew into a better life.
Do not neglect this power of prayer,
But with all care prepare your heart,
And bring your loved one home.

Nor only when communion is not yet come should you

prepare for pious thoughts,

But anxiously preserve that holy thought when the taking
of the sacrament is done.

There is required of us no less,

That after-watch upon ourselves,

Than the good thoughts that go before.

For a close guard kept afterwards

Is the best of ways to get a greater share of grace another
time;

And thoughts once seattered to the comforts from without

Make men exceedingly reluctant.*

Beware of talking much ς
Stay by yourself,
Enjoy your G0d;
For you have One,

Whom all the world cannot take from you.
’Tis Ι,

To WVhom you must give all yourself ;

No longer in yourself to live,

But—all care set aside—in Me.

¹⁸² That is, reluctant to communicate.
