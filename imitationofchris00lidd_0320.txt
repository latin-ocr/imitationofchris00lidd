288 DENYING SELF.

I arn the straitest way,
The highest truth‚
The real, the blest, the uncreated life.
If you continue in My way you shall know truth,
And truth shall make you free,
’ And you shall grasp eternal life.

If you would enter into life,
Keep the commandments.
If you would know the truth,
Trust Me.
If you would be perfect,
Sell all.
If you would be My disciple,
Deny yourself.
If you would gain the blessed life,
Scorn that which passes by.
If you would rise high in heaven
Be lowly in the world,
If you would reign with Me,
Carry the Cross with Me ;
For only seryants of the Cross
Find out the road of true light and of bliss.

11.
The Soul.

Dec. 17. Lord Jesus, as Thy way was strait and by the world
contemned,
Grant me to follow Thee, contempt and all.
The servant is no greater than his master,
Nor the disciple than his lord.

Let Thy life be Thy servant’s task ; ²*

’¹‘ Exerccatur servus tuus in vita tua; that is, he is to ground
his duties of lise on the methods of Jesus.
