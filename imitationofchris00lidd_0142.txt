112 GOD’S GOODNESS AND CHARJTV.

A creature—unto the Creator ;

A soul in desolation——to my holy Comsorter.
But whence is this,

That Thou shouldst come to me?

And what arn Ι,

That Thou shouldst show Thyself to me 't'

How dares the sinner to appear before Thee,
And Thou, how deignest Thou to come to him ’ἓ
Thou knowst Thy slave,

That he has nothing good in him

That Thou shouldst grant him this.

Wherefore 1 confess my vileness ;

1 recognise Thy goodness ;

I praise Thy pity,

And give Thee thanks for Thine exceeding charity.
For Thou dost this for Thyself‚

Not for any good in me ;

That Thy goodness may be better known of me,
Thy charity more fully brought to me,

Thy lowliness more perseetly borne in on me.
80, forasmuch as this is pleasing unto Thee,
And Thou hast willed it should be so,

Thy condescension also *pleases me.

Would God that my unrighteousness stood not in my

way.

Sweetest and kindest Jesus,

How great the reverence, the thanks, the never-ceasing
praise, due to Thee for our taking of Thy sacred

No man ilgofihhd who can unfold it worthily,

But what shall 1 think when Ι come in this communion
unto my God—my God, Whom worthily 1 cannot

reverence ’Β
