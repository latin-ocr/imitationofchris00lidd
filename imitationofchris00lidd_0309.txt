GOD'S GRA CE. 277

But if he really would be spiritual,

He must give up the near ones and the far,
Dreading no one more than self.

Win the battle o'er yourself,
And you will easily put the rest to rout.
It is a perfect victory,
This triumph over self.
The man who keeps himself in hand,—
Sense slave to reason,
Reason slave in all to Me,—
He is the victor of himself, lord of the world.

And if in mounting to this height you slip,
Then like a man begin again, and put the axe unto the
root;
Drag out and kill the hidden ill-ordered tendency,
That leads to self and to all selfish and material good.

On this one fault—that man seeks his own good too
much—-
Nigh every evil hangs,
That from its root must be subdued.
And this once beaten and conquered‚
Great peace and quietness shall ever reign.
But as few try to die perfectly to self,
And never aim outside themselves,
Theresore they are entangled in the suares,
And cannot lift themselves above themselves in spirit.

The man who longs freely to walk with Me
Must kill all wicked and ill-reined affections,
And not cleave lustfully srorn selfish love to any creature.
