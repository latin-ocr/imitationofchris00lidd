262 THE ETERNAL DAY.

When call to mind Thee only, Lord,

And when rejoice my fill in Thee ἲ

When shall I be quit of hindrance,

Really set free without a weight on mind or body ⁴?

When shall solid peace come to me, peace that cannot be
broken, within, without,

Firm on all sides Ῥ

When shall I, good Jesus, stand to look on Thee,

And muse upon the glory of Thy kingdom ’.Ρ

When wilt Thou be all in all to me ’.Ρ

And when shall Ι be with Thee in Thy sovereignty,

Prepared for Thy beloved from eternity'?

1 am lest poor and exiled in a foeman's land,

Where there is daily war

And great missortune.

11.
Comfort my exiled state,
Lessen my grief,
For all my longing soul siglis up to Thee.
All that this world offers me as comfort
Is a mere burden to me.

1 would enjoy Thee inwardly,

Yet I cannot grasp Thee.

I long to cleave to heavenly things,

But things of time and passions not yet dead oppose me.

ln mind I would be lord of all,

But by my ssesh against my will Ι am bound down to
slavery.

So I, unhappy man, am fighting with myself,

Ι have become a trouble to myself ;

The spirit longs to be on high, the ssesh below.

O what I suffer within me while with the mind 1 handle
things of heaven,
