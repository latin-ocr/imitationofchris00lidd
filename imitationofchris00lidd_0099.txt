LOWLY SUBMISSION. 71

All you meet would turn to good, would help you on your
way.

It is because you are not fully dead to your own mortal self,

Nor separate from earth,

That many a thing grates on you and disturbs your peace.

Nothing so spots the heart of man,

Nothing entangles it so much,

As a foul longing for created things.

Refuse the comforts from without,

And you will shout for joy within, and often catch a glimpse
of heaven.

CHAPTER ΙΙ.

Lowly Submz'ssz'on.

AKE not much thought who is for you or against you;
But think and care for this,
That God be with yon, whatsoe'er you do.
Keep a good conscience,
And He will shield you well;
For him whom God will help
Man’s malice cannot harm.
If you can only hold your peace and suffer,
Without a doubt you shall perceive some help from God.
He knows when He will set you free and how,
And you must leave yourself to Him.
It is God’s work——to help
And set men free from all confusion.

Osten it aids us much to keep us in a humbler walk,
That other men know of our faults and talk of them.
When men are humble for their failings,

Then they easily calm others,
And lightly satisfy all that are wroth with them.
