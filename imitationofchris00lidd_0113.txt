ΝΟ CONSOLATION. 83

And never wish that any one should set his heart on you,
Nor set your own heart upon any.

Let Him be in you

And in the hearts of all the good.

April ¹1· Be pure and free within,
Untrammelled by the love of anything created.
Bring to your God a naked heart and clean,
If you would rest and see
How gracious is the Lord.
And truly you will never come to this
Unless His grace go on before you, and it draw you on
To free yourself and say sarewell to all,
That you may be alone with Him, and He with you, both
one.
When God’s favour comes to man,
He can do anything;
And when it ebbs from him,
It leaves him poor and weak,
A slave, left to his beating—
Yet iu this he must not be cast down,
Must not despair ;
But stand with even mind to do the will of God,
And suffer all that comes to him,
For the honour of the name of Jesus Christ.
For summer follows hard on winter,
And after night returns the day,
After a storm, great calm.

CHAPTER IX.
No Consolatz'on.

April 12 T is not hard to seorn man’s consolation
When God’s is near at hand.
But it is a very grand thing so to live
