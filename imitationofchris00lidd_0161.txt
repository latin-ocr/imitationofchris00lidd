THE OFFERING OF OURSELVES. 131

All who have wished and asked of me for prayers and
masses to be sung for them and theim,

WVhether t‘hey yet live m the ssesh or have already done
their labour' in the world;

That all may feel Thy helping touch,
And Thy consoling power,

Thy hand in peril,

Thy freedom from their punishment,
That they be snatehed from every evil,
Joyfully giving exeeeding praise to Thee.

V.

ι e . Ι offer too to Thee

Prayers and victims* to appease Thee,

For those in special who have injured me in aught‚
saddened me or reviled me,

Or brought some loss or trouble on me ;

And for all those whom I have sometimes saddened,
Disturbed, offended, grieved,

By word or deed, knowingly or in ignorance,
That Thou wouldst pardon all our sins alike,
And all our evils done to one another.

Take from our hearts, O Lord,
Suspicion, anger, beat, dispute,
All that ean injure charity
And spoil the love of brothers.

Pity, pity those, O Lord,
That ask Thy pity.
Give grace to those that need it3
Make us such
That we be worthy to enjoy Thy favour 3
And gain eternal life.

Amen.
