TWO VIEWS OF LIFE. 281

Life touched by God seeks nothing temporal,

And asks, for pay, no other boon save God alone,

And wants no more of what is needful on the earth

Save just as much as leads the soul to follow the eternal

aim.

The life of man is glad of friends and kinsfolk,

Boasts of long ancestry and noble standing,

Smiles on the proud,

Fawns on the rich,

Claps those that do as it does.

Life touched by God loves—yes--its enemies;

No crowd of friends raises its pride ;

Pride of place and birth are naught with it, save when
greater worth goes with them.

1t looks with kindlier eye upon the poor than on the rich;

Shows sympathy, not With the powerful, but with the
harmless;

Smiles with the truth-lover, not with the liar;

Ever cheers on the good to try to get the better gifts,

And by their virtues to be like the Son of God.

The life of man soon grumbles over trouble and defeat;
Life touched by God bears want with constancy.

The life of man turns all things back to self,
And for itself it strives and quarrels;
Life touched by God brings all things back to Him from

Whom at first they ssow.

Giving no good unto itself, nor arrogantly presuming,
lt quarrels not, and does not put its own opinions first,
But in all that has to do with sense and understanding
Bows tothe eternal wisdom of the test of God.

The life of man would know all secrets and would hear
all news,
