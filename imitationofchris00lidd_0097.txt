THE HIGHER LIFE WITHIN. 69

When this is not your rest?

Your horne should be in heaven3

And all the sights of earth

Are to be looked at as a passing sh0w;

Passing, passing by,—

And you with them.

See that you cling not to them,

For fear you be ensnared and perish.

Your thoughts must be with God on high,

Your prayers unceasingly must go straight up to Christ.

And if you know not how to muse on high and heavenly
themes,

Rest your thoughts on what Christ suffered,
And let them love to dwell upon His holy wounds ;
For if you hurry with good thoughts
To Jesus' wounds and to the precious nail-prints,
In your trials you will feel great comfort ;
You will think but little of the scorn of men,
And with ease you will endure detracting words.
For He when in the world was seorned of men,
Left amid insults in His greatest need
By all His friends and those who knew Him best.
Could Christ so suffer and be scorned,
And is there anything you dare to wail for ’.Ρ
Christ had His enemies and men that spoke against Him,
And do you want to find all friends and helpers ’.Ρ
Where shall the crown be for your suffering
lf no cross meets you on your way ’.Ρ
And if you will have nothing go against you
How can you be His friend ’.Ρ
If you would reign with Him,
Bear up with Him; bear up for Him,
Had you once wholly entered to His inner life,
