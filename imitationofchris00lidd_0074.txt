Now you bethink you to be on your guard,

And in an hour you go and act

As if the thought had never crossed your mind.

We are right then to bring ourselves to lowliness,

And never have high thoughts,

Because we are so frail, so weak.

Soon we may lose, because of our neglect,

What with much toil we thought we had gained at last
through God's good favoun*

What in the end then will become of us,
Lukewarm so soon upon the‘road?
Woe be to us if we would sink in rest,
As though it were now the time for peace and careless days,
While yet there is not seen a trace of holiness as we go upon
our way.

Very needful would it be that, like young neophytes, we
should again be led to all the ways that are the
best ;

If there perchance might be some hope for better things
in days to be,
And greater progress on the heavenly road.

CHAPTER XXIII.
Musz'ng on Death.

OON, so soon, it will be over with you here;
Think how it may be with you—there.
Man lives to—day,
To-morrow he is gone,
And when he passes from the eyes of men,
Even so soon he passos from the mind.

ἅ( Gratiam.
