THE CONFESSION OF OUR WEAKNESS. 205

And everywhere lie foes and snares ;

For, as one trouble or temptation ebbs, another ssows;
Yes, while the battle with the first still rages,

Others we thought not of throng on in crowds.

How can we love life,

Full of such bitterness as this ἰ’

How call it life—-

Mother of plagues and death Ῥ

Yet it is loved,

And many seek delight in it.

Men often blame the world ; “it is deceit and vanity ς ”

And yet they leave it with a struggle,

Because of sseshly lusts that are their kings.

Some things make men love it.

Lust of the ssesh,

Lust of the eyes, the pride of life,

Draw men to its breast.

The penalties and miseries

That justly follow in their train

Make men hate it, make men sick of it.

But, sad it is, wickecl delights still rule the world-gIven
soul;

And the soul thinks it sweet to lie on thorns,

Because it never saw nor tasted God’s sweetness and
the pleasantness that virtue breeds within.

But they who really scorn it all,
And try to live to God beneath some holy rule‚
They know full well this heavenly sweetness, promised to
all who truly give up all.
They see with brighter eyes
How grievously the world goes blundering on, cheated on
every side)⁶
