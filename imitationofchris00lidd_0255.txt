IN TRIBULATJON. 223

11.

Oce 3. Your peace should not rest in the tongues of men,
Their guesses of you may be good or evil 3
You are not therefore changed.

Where is true peace, real glory ’.Ρ
15 it not in Me?
He who cares not to please mankind, and fears not their
displeasure,
Shall enjoy deep peace.
From unchecked love and empty sear
Arises all unquietness of heart,
And all distraction of the senses.

CHAPTER XXIX.

When T rz'bulatz'on comes, God should be Called
Upon and Blessed.

Oct· 4- ΗΥ name, Ο Lord, be blest for ever,
Who willedst that this trial and temptation should
come on me.
I cannot get away from it,
But I must needs fly unto Thee,
To help me and to turn it unto good for me.

O Lord, IL

Now Ι am in trouble,

And with my heart it is not well,

But I am much vexed by my present suffering.
And now, dear Father, what arn I to say,
Caught in the snares ’ἓ

“ Save me from this hour‘?

But for this cause Ι came unto this hour,”
