No CURJOSJTY. 155

Jugy ⁷· All reason and all natural questioning

Should follow saith,

Not go before it, nor too close to it.

For saith and love are best of all in this‚*

And work in hidden ways in this most holy and surpassing
sacrament.

The Eternal God, past measure, infinite in power,

Does great things that we cannot search into in earth and
heaven.

1f all the works of God were such

That human minds could understand them,

No need to call Him wonderful, ineffable.†

* That is, in the sacrament.
† This book has no colophon⁴
