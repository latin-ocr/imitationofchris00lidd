CHAPTER 1.

T [τε Inward Speech of Christ unto tlte Fat'thful
δοιώ*

luly 8· Ι WILL hear what the Lord God may say in me.
Blest is the soul that hears its Lord's voice speaking
within it,
And takes the word of comfort from His lips.
Blest are the ears that catch the throbbing whisper of the
Lord,
And turn not to the buzzings of the passing world ;
That listen not to voices from without,
But to the truth that teaches from within.
Blest are the eyes
That, shut to outer things,
Are busied with the inner life.
Blest are they who penetrate within,
And more and more by daily use
Strive to prepare themselves
To take the heavenly mysteries.
And blest are they who try to give their time to God,
And shake them free from all the burden of the world.

*This book is in great part a dialogue between God or

Christ, the author, and the soul.
