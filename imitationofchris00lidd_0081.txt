JUDGMENT AND PUNISHMENT OF SIN. 55

And here we now and then enjoy the comfort of our
friends.

There is no rest,

No comfort for the lost.

Be anxious now, be woeful now
Over your sins,
That in the judgment-day you may be safe among the
blest.

Then shall the just arise, and shall stand firm
Against the foes that tortured and oppressed thern.
Then shall those as judges stand

Who now in all humility bow to the sentences of men.
Then shall the poor and humble be confident indeed.

Then shall the proud be terror-struck on every side.
Then shall he seem to have been wise in this his life
Who learned to be a fool and to be scorned for Christ.

Then shall his harrowing cares so patiently endured
Be but a pleasant memory‚
And all iniquity shall stop her mouth.
And every pious soul shall sing for joy,
And every worldly soul shall cry for grief ;
And the hard-burdened body shall exult far more
Than if it had been always nourished
In the lap of all delights.
Then shall the cheap coat glitter with its splendour,
And the subtly woven robe grow black as night.
Then shall the lowly hut of poverty be praised
More than the palace walls picked out with gold;
And steadfast patience be of more avail
Than all high-handed worldly power.

Obedience, plain obedience shall then higher stand
Than all the cunning of the passing ages.
