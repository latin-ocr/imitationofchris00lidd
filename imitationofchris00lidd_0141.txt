GOD'S GOODNESS AND CHARITY. 111

May ¹⁴· Blind‚ blind and hard are human hearts,
That think not more upon a gift whose worth cannot be told,

And that from daily custom even drist into neglect ;
For if this holy sacrament were celebrated in one place
alone,

And by one priest alone,
How men would long, think you, for that one place, and

for such a priest of God,
To see him celebrate the mysteries divine.

But now are many priests,

And Christ is offered up in many places,
That God's kindness and His love to men
May be seen to be the greater,

The farther that the sacred rite

Is scattered through the earth.

Thanks be to Thee‚ Jesus, good shepherd everlasting,
That with Thy precious body and Thy blood didst deign
to seed us, exiles and in poverty,
And call us to receive this mystery with words of Thine

own mouth,

‘⁴ Corne unto Me,
All ye that labour and are heavy laden,

And Ι will give you rest.''

CHAPTER ΙΙ.

Great is God’s Goodness‚ Great His Chart'ty,
shown in the Sacrament to Man.

The Voice of the Learner.

May ι5· ΙΝ Thy goodness and great mercy trusting, O my Lord,
Sick—I come unto the Healer ;
Hungry and thirsty—to life’s Founta'in ;
Α slave—unto the Master ;
