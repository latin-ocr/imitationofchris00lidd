296 THE SECRETS OF GOD.

And with a humble mind to ask their glorious suffrages,
Than to dig deep into their secrets in a vain inquiry.

The saints are very well content,

If men would learn contentment, and stop their empty talk.

They boast not of their merits,

For they ascribe no goodness to themselves, but all to Me ;

For I have given them everything from My unending
charity.

So greatly are they filled with love of My divinity, and with
a joy passing all bounds‚

That there is nothing lacking to their glory,

No happiness they want.

The higher that theyall are in the glory,

The deeper is their own humility,

The nearer and the dearer are they unto Me

And thus you have it written,

That they put down their crowns before the Lord, and fell
upon their faces in the presence of the Lamb,

And worshipped Him that liveth for the ages.

111.

Many ask who is greater in God’s kingdom,
Who know not whether they are worthy to be compared
unto the least.
It is a great thing to be even the least in heaven,
Where all are great,
For all shall be called sons of God, and shall be so.
The smallest shall be as a thousand,
And a sinner of a hundred years shall die*

For when Christ's followers asked who was the greater in
the kingdom,
This was the answer ε

'¹' That is, shall die a sinner.
