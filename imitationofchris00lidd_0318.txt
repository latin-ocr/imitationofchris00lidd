286 NA TURE ’S C ORR UP T J ΟΝ.

Come Thou, come down to me,
Fill me early with Thy consolation,
Lest my soul faint for very weariness and drought.

Ι pray Thee, Lord, that Ι may find favour before Thee;
Thy gracious favour is enough for me,
Though Ι gain not the other things that nature wants.
If Ι shall be tried and vexed with many tribulations,
I will fear no evil
While Thy favouring inssuence stays with me.
It is my strength,
It brings me aid and tells me what 'to do;
It is stronger than all foes,
Mistress of truth,
Teacher of discipline,
Light of the heart,
Solaee in pressing times ;
It puts to ssight my sorrow,
It takes away my fear,
It nurses my devotion,
It makes my tears to ssow.
Without it, what am I ’.Ρ A withered log,
A useless stump, to be cast forth.

Theu let Thy favouring influence, Lord, ever go before
and follow me,
And make me ever busy in good works,
Through Jesus Christ, Thy Son.
Amen.
