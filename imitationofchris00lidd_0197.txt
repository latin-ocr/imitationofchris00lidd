THE WORDS OF GOD. . 165

God.

1, saith the Lord, have taught the prophets
From the beginning of the world,
And to this day I cease not speaking unto all.
But many to My voice are dull and hard,
Many would rather hear the world than God,
Stepping lightly after sseshly appetitos,
Following slowly God's good pleasure.

The promise of the world means things of time, small
things,
And with great eagerness men make themselves its slaves.
My promise is of things eternal‚ mighty things,
And yet the hearts of men are dull to Me.
Who serves Me, listens to Me, with the care
With which men serve and listen to the world ’ἒ
Blush‚ O Sidon, says the sea,
And if you ask why, hear.
To get a little, men run far;
But for eternal life
Many searce lift a foot once off the ground.
Men look for worthless gains ;
They sometimes basely quarrel at the law over one coin,
And, for some empty trifle or some little promise,
They sear not weariness both day and night 3

But (shame on them) to win a blessing beyond change and
chance,

A prize above all value,

Eternal honour, glory without end,

They are too dull to risk never so little weariness.
Blush then, servant, slow, complaining,

For men are found far readier for perdition

Than you for life;
