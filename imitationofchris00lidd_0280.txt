248 OUR PEACE.

CHAPTER XLII.

Our Peace is not to be in Human Keepz'ng.
God.

Nov. 3. Y son,
lf you put your peace with any one because you
live with him and think as he does*

You will be wavering and entangled.

Betake yourself unto the truth that ever lives, that ever
stays ;

Then partings and the death of friends shall never sadden
you.

Love for your friend should have its root in Me,

And every one that here seems good to you and very dear,

Should, for My sake, be loved.

Apart from Me friendship is nothing, cannot last,

And there is no pure love, nor true,

Where Ijoin not the lovers.

11.

Nov. ⁴· So dead you should be unto such affections for beloved

ones,

That you should wish to be without human companionship
as far as it may be;

The farther that a man goes back from every earthly solace,

The more the man draws near to God.

The deeper that a man goes down into himself,

The cheaper that he grows in his own sight.

The higher he goes up towards God.

But he who puts down any good to self,

Hinders the grace of God from coming in on him ς

For the Holy Spirit's grace doth always seek a humble heart.
