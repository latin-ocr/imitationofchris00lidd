276' GOD’S GRA σε.

CHAPTER LIII.

Gods Grace does not go well wz‘tlz a T aste for
Earthly T lzz'ngS.

God.

My grace is precious;
It will not rningle with the outer world,
Nor with the comforts of the earth.
Thus you must cast aside all things that hinder it,
If you would drink it in and make it part of you.*

Seek for yourself a secret spot,
Love to dwell lonely by yourself,
Ask for none to gossip with,
But rather pour your pious prayer to God,
That you may keep a saddened mind, a conscience pure.
Value all the world at nothing,
Put your quiet hour for God before all outside cares.
For you cannot find an hour for Me,
And take your pleasure too in what goes by.
You must get far away from what you know and love,
And keep⁷ your mind unto itself, barring out tempora]
solace.
Thus blessed Peter the apostle begs us,

That the faithful souls of Christ
Should hold themselves as pilgrims and as strangers here.

How trustsul will you be when death is nigh,
If love of nothing keeps you in the world.
But this—the keeping of the heart away from all-
Man’s ailing mind is not yet trained to it,
Nor does the animal man know what the freedom is of the
inward lise.
