THE MANV KJNDNESSES OF GOD. 209

Because you called on Me.

Your tears, the longing of your soul,

Your humbleness, the sorrows of your beart,
Have brought Me down, have led Me near.

The SouL
And I said,
⁴⁴ Lord, 1 did call on Thee.
I wished for joy in Thee,
Ready to cast out all for Thee.
Thou didst come first and urgedst me
To look for Thee.
Blessed be Thou, O Lord,
So good unto Thy servant, according to the greatness of
Thy pity.
What can I say more in Thy presence,
But humbly lay myself before Thee,
Mindful of my iniquity and worthlessness ’.Ρ
For there is none like Thee
Mid all the wonders of the heaven and earth.
Thy works are very good,
Thy judgments true,
And by Thy foresight all is 'ruled.
Praise then to Thee and glory,
O Wisdom os the Father ;
Bless and praise Him, O my lips,
My soul and all things that are made.”
