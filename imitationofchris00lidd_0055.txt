BEARING WITH WEAKNESSES. 29

And if you do not make yourself all that you wish,
How can you bring another to your will?

We would have others saints,
And yet we do not root our failings out;
We would have others sternly blamed,
And yet we love not to be blamed ourselves;
Displeased we are when others have free scope to act,

And yet we would not be refused in anything we ask for3
We would have others bound by laws,

And yet in no case can we bear a bond too close.

Thus it is plain how rare it is for us to weigh our
neighbours
In the same balance with ourselves.

111.

Were all men saints,
What would be left for us to bear
At others' hands to please our God Ῥ
But now has God ordained
That we should leam to carry each the burden of another.

None is without his failings,
None without his burden,

None strong enough for his own needs‚

None wise enough.

We take our turns to lift the burden from each other,
We take our turns to comfort and console,

To help, to counsel, and to teaeh.

And each man’s work
Shows clearer in the days when men oppose him.
These days make ‚no man frail;
They only point to him,
“ There is the man?
