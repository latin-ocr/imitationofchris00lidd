CHAPTER XXXVII.

A Pure and Simple Resigtmtz'on to get the F reedom
of the Heart.

God.

Y sou,

Leave self,
You shall find Me.
Take your place—no choosing it——no saying, “This is mine‚''
And you shall always gain ;
For fuller favour shall be added to you,
The moment you resign yourself,
If you keep so.

11.

The Soul.

Lord, how oft must I resign myself,
And in what leave myself ’.θ

God.

Always; in every hour,
In small things and in great.
I except nothing ;
Always would I find you bare of self;
Else how can you be Mine or I be yours,
Unless you spoil yourself, within, without, of all sels-will ’.Ρ
The sooner this is done the better it will be tor you;
The fuller and the more sincerely done,
The more you will please Me,
The greater will your profit be.

Some do renounce themselves,
Making exceptions.
They do not wholly trust in God,
And have their hands full in providing for themselves
