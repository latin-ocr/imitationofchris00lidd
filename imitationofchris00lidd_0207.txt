THE PROOF OF A TRUE LOVER. 175

That good and sweet affection which you sometimes feel
Comes from present grace,

And is a foretaste of the heavenly country.

You must not strive for it too much ;

It comes and goes. '

But strive against the evil passions of the mind,

Scorn all the whispers of the fiend ;

Τ leat is the mark of worth and of great merit.

Then let no foreign phantoms trouble you,

Born of whatever cause they best*

Keep a brave plan before you,

And a right motive towards your God.

'Tis no illusion to be rapt into a sudden ecstasy,

Though you may soon return to the old follies of the
heart;

These sollies you unwillingly endure ;

You do not act them ;

And if they be displeasing to you, and you strive against
thern,

It is a merit and no loss.

Know this; the old enemy is ever trying to stop your
longings for the good,
To keep you free from every holy practice,
From reverencing the saints,
From the remembranee of My passion,
From the useful thoughts about your sins,
From the watch upon your heart,
And from your strong plan to do better.
Many an evil thought he plants
To make you weary of yourself, 'to srighten you ;
To call you from your prayers and holy reading.
