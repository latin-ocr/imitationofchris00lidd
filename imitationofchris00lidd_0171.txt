PREPARA TJON. 141

Though you should spend a year to get you ready, thinking
of nothing else,

Can you make this preparation good enough.

It is My holiness and kindness that suffers you to draw
near to My table;

As though a beggar were invited to some rich man's feast,

And he had nothing else to give him for his kindness

But lowliness and thanks.

Do what in you lies, and do it carefully ;
Not that it is the custom, not that you are bound,
But with fear and reverence;
And lovingly receive the body of the Lord, your God
beloved, Who deigns to come to you.
I am He that bade you,
I have willed it to be done,
Ι will fill up what fails in you 3
Come, take Me.

11.

When Ι give you the power to worship Me,alt give thanks
unto your God 3
Not that you are worthy,
But that Ι pitied you.

Maybe the soul is dry, the power is gone ;
Continue still in prayer,
Moan on and knock upon the door,
And stay not till you win a drop, a crumb of power to help
your prayers.
You are in want of Me,
Not 1 of you.
You do not come to make Me holy,
1 come to make you holy and to better you.

* Gratiam devotionis.
