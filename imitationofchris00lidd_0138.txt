108 REVERENCE IN TAKJNG CHRIST.

A distance great enough

Between those victims of the Law,

The shadowy signs of all that was to corne,

And the true victim of Thy body,

The final sacrifice of all the offerings of the ancient world.

Why do I not glow more to meet Thy reverend presence,

Why with no greater care do I prepare me, to take Thy
holy gift ;

When saints and seers and patriarchs of old,

And kings and chiefs and all the people of the land,

Showed such devotion to the worship of their God Ῥ

111.

Before the ark of God, King David, pious king, danced
with all his might,

Mindful of the kindnesses of old shown to his fathers.
Organs he made of every sort ;

He wrote the psalms,

And set the land with joy to sing them;

And often to the lyre himself he sang,

Filled with the Holy Spirit’s grace.

He taught his people Israel

To praise their God with all their heart,

And every day with tuneful voice to bless and tell His
deeds.

Isin those days devotion flourished thus,

And thus the praise of God was called to mind
Before the testamental ark,

How great in me and all the Christian world
Should be the reverence and devotion,

When the sacrament is here,

When we take up the all-surpassing body of Christ.
