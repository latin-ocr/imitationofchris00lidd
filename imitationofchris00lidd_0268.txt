236 No SAFETY.

Sad, sad—yet still the old man lives in me,
He is not really crucified,
He is not really (lead,
He fiercely lusts against the spirit still,
He stirs the war within,
He will not let the kingdom of the soul be quiet.

But Thou, Lord of the mighty sea, smoother of the
heaving waves,
Arise and help.
Scatter the people that delight in war,
Bruise them in Thy power,
Show, Ι pray, Thy mighty deeds,
Let Thy right hand be croxvned with glory.
There is for me no hope, no haven,
Save in Thee, O Lord, my God.

CHAPTER XXXV.
No Safety from Temptatz'on all through Lzse.
God.

Y son,
L You are not ever safe in life,
Long as you live you need the spiritual armour,
Ever amid foes,

Assaulted right and left.

If then you do not use the shield of patience,
You will not stay unwounded long.
Again, unless you put your heart in Me and keep it there,
With single wish to go through all for Me,
You will not keep that ardour up,
Nor win the palm-branch of the blest.
You ought to pass through all things like a man,
Baring a powerlul hand against opposition.
