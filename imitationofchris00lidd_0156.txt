126 PLANS FOR JMPROVEMEND

Dull at God's Word,

Swift to rest,

Slow to toil,

Wakeful at a story,

Sleepy at your holy vigils‚

Hurrying to the end,

Wandering in attention,

Careless in your saying of the hours,*
Cool in the celebration‚

Parched in communion,

So soon with thoughts distracted,

So rarely fully gathered to yourself,
So quickly moved to anger,

So ready to displease your neighbour,
Eager to judge,

Stern to condemn,

Merry in prosperous days,

Weak in adversity,

So often laying down good rules,
Carrying but little to the end.

And when you have confessed and wept for these and
other failings, with grief and great disgust at your
own weakness,

Set before you a firm plan to mend your lise from day to day,
¹And go the better on your road.

May 31· Then with full resignation willingly offer yourself upon
the altar of your heart, as a burnt-offering that
will last sor ever, unto the honour of My name,

By trustsully committing to My care body and soul,

That thus perchance you may be dcemed worthy to come
and offer sacrifice to God,

And take My body’s sacrament unto your health.

* That is, the horarium, or book of the hours.
