God.

Nov. 12. Y ΞΟΠ,
Stand firm and hope in Me.
For what are words but words ?
They ssy through air,
But do not hurt a stone.
If you are guilty,
Think—you would wish to mend yourself.
If you are conscious of no wrong,
Think—you would willingly bear this for God.
Little enough for you to bear words now and then ; ²¹*
You cannot yet stand sturdy blows. ’

And why do such small things pierce to the heart,
If you aro not still of the ssesh,
And think of men more than you should ’ἓ
For as you would not be despised,
You do not want blame for your saults,
And seek the petty Shadows of excuses.
Look within you deeper still,
And you will see the world yet living there,
And the vain love to please mankind.
For as you shun to be brought low
And put to shzune for your defects,
It is quite clear you are not truly humbled,
Nor really dead unto the world,
Nor the world crucified to you.

Nov. ¹3· But hear My word;

* That is, you deserve blows : why then mind mere words?
