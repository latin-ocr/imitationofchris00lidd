TRUST FEW. 255

From such tales, from such careless men, deliver me,
O Lord, that Ι fall not into their hands,
Nor ever do the like.
Give me a true word and a firm one in my lips;
Take from me a cunning tongue,
For what 1 would not have done unto me,
1 ought in every way to shun.

111.

How good it is, what quictness it brings,
To keep silence about others,
And not to credit everything alike‚
Nor lightly to continue talking;
To show oneself to few,
To seek for Thee that gazest deep into the heart;
Not to be blown about with any windy word,
But to long that all our inner and our outer course may be
fulfilled according to Thy will.

How safe it is, if we would keep God’s favour,

To shun the world's ‘⁴ appearances‚'’

And not to seek what seems to win approval from without,

But with all carefulness to follow after all that gives zeal
to life and betters it.

How many have been hurt when men have got to know
their worth and praised them;

How many have been profited by grace in silence kept
through this frail life,

This life, “all toil and war.”
