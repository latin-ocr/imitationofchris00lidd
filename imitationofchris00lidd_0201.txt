HOW WE OUGHT To WALK. 169

Worthy of fame,

Naught high, naught truly worth a word of praise, naught
worth a wish,

Save the eternal.

Let truth eternal please you above all,

And your own worthlessness displease you.

Fear, blame, and shun nothing so much

As faults and sins ;

They should displease you more than any loss of wealth.

Some do not walk before Me with a perfect beart,
But, led by curiosity and pride,
They wish to know My secrets,
And understand deep things of God ;
With never a thought unto themselves,
Nor to their own salvation.
These often slip down into sin and great temptation,
For Ι oppose their pride and prying ways.
Fear God’s judgments,
And be afraid of the Almighty’s wrath ;
But question not the works of the Most High.
Look to your own iniquities,
And see how greatly you have sinned,
And how much good you have passed by.

Some carry their devotion only in their books,
Some in their pictures,
Some in outward shapes and signs;
Some have Me on the lip,

But little in the heart.

Others there are who with enlightened understanding
and affections purged,
Pant ever for the eternal,
Listening unwillingly to earthly things,
And with sorrow serving nature’s needs.
