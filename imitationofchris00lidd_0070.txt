44 HEART-SORROW.

Yet when a man is wholly sorry for his sin,

Then the whole world is as a burden to him, and a bitter
draught.

111.

The good man finds enough for mourning and for tcars,
WVhether he muses on himself

Or ponders on the lives of those about him.

He knows no man lives here quite free from piercing care,
And the closer that he looks upon himself,

The greater is his moan.

Matter enough for grief and sorrow from within are all
the sins and faults,
Wherein we lie so tangled,
That we can rarely see the things of heaven.

Did you but oftener muse upon your death
Than on the length of life,
You would improve with greater zeal.
If in your heart of hearts you would but weigh hell’s future
torments, purgatory’s pains,
Ι fancy you would willingly endure labour and grief,
And you would shrink from no stern rule;
But since these thoughts never get down into the heart,
Since we still cling to siren pleasures,
We stay quite cold, quite dull.

It is because our spirit is so miserably poor
That the wretched body so easily laments.
Pray then humbly to your God
To give to you a spirit of repentance,

And with the prophet say,
‘⁸ Feed me, Ο Lord, with bread of mourning,
And give me plenteousness of tears to drink.'’
