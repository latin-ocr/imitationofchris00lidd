204 THE CONFESSION OF OUR WEAKNESS.

But in a slight temptation

Great is my strait.

Often a very mean thing brings a grievous trial,

And, thinking I am safe—-but for a little,

Feeling not the trouble,

I find my bark nigh wrecked by a slight gust of wind.

Look, Lord. upon my low estate, my frailty, known

every way to Thee.

Pity and snatch me from the mire,

That I stick not fast in it,

And be not quite cast down for ever.

This often drives me, like an echo, back again,

Confuses me before Thee,—

Ι am so frail, so weak,

In fighting with my passions ;

And if I do not wholly yield,

Yet they come after me, trouble, distress me,

And Ι grow very weary of this life of struggle.

I know my weakness well from this,

That the abominable phantoms hurry in more easily than
they depart.

O God of Israel, strong in strength, guard of the faithful

soul, look down upon Thy servant's toil and grief ;

Help him in all his goings,

Strengthen him with bravery from heaven

Lest the old man, the wretched ssesh, prevail and lord it
over me—

The ssesh, not yet subdued unto the spirit,

Against which ssesh Ι must needs fight

As long as in this wretched life Ι breathe.

Oh what a thing is life— 11.

Sadness and trials never fail in it,
