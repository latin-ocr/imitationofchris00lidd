CHAPTER 1.

Of Imttatz'ng Christ and Scorm‘ng all the World’s

Van illes.

Jan. ¹· ‘⁴ E that followeth after Me walks not in the darkness ; '⁹
Thus saith the Lord.
These are Christ’s words, and by them we are told
How far to imitate His lise and ways,
If we would be truly filled with light,
And from all blindness of our hearts be set at liberty.
Therefore our stu'dy above all must be
Upon the life of Jesus Christ to ponder.

His teaching passes all the teaching of the saints,
And he who has the spirit of Christ
Would find the manna hidden there,
But it is thus, that many a man,
Hearing the Gospel ever and again,
Feels for it little longing,
Because the spirit of Christ is none of his.
Yet he who would in all their fulness
Taste and know the words of Christ,
Must study to make all his life like in its beauty
unto His.
