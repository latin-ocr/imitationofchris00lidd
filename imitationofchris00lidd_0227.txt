A PRA YER. 19 ς

Many are cheated at the last who seemed at first
To take a holy spirit for their guide.

Aug. 2⁴· Whatever then crosses the mind
As something to be wished for,
See that the longing be with sear of God and lowliness.
And, above all, resigning self to Me,
Trust Me quite and say,
‘⁴ Lord, Thou knowest
In what way it is better.
Let this or that be as Thou wilt.

Give to me what Thou wilt,
How much Thou wilt,

And when„ Thou wilt.

Do with me as Thou knowest, and as it pleases Thee.
Put me where Thou wilt,

Deal freely with me every day.

In Thine hand Ι am;

Wheel me and turn me back again.

See, I am Thy slave,

Ready for everything.

1 would not live unto myself, but unto Thee 3

1 wish Ι could, worthily, perfectly.”

11.

A ug. 25· Yield me Thy favour, kindest Jesus,
To be with me, to share my work,
To stay with me unto the end.

Give me to long and wish sor this,
Thy will and what is dear to Thee.
