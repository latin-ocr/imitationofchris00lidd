230 NEGLECT OF EVERY CREATURE.

And scarcely even now and then gather our senses up, and
muse upon our inner life.

Oh it is sad ; we think a little, and at once we break away,

And never put our works into the scale and mark them
carefully,

Caring not where our love is,

Weeping not that everything is sotimpure.

All ssesh had spoilt its way,

And the great ssood followed.

Thus when our inward love is much corrupted,

It must needs be

That the act which follows, the sign how much we need
the strength within,

Should be corrupted too.

From a pure heart proceeds a good life’s fruit.

We ask how much a man has done;
But with what goodness it is done,
We weigh not that so carefully.
Was he brave, rich, fair and comely ’.Ρ
Α good copyist, a good singer, a hard worker Ῥ
All this we ask.
But—was he poor in spirit Ῥ
Quiet and kind ’.Ρ
Pious, and a lover of the higher life ’.Ρ
We hold our tongues on this.
The life of man looks at the outward show3
Life touched by God turns its glauce within.‘
The former often fails ;
The other, not to be deceived, puts all‘her hope in God.
