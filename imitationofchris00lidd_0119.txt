GRATJTUDE FOR GOD’S KINDNESS. 89

Kindness is always due to him who will give kindly thanks
for it;

And what is granted to the humble will be taken from the
proud.

Ι refuse a comfort
That takes from me my sorrow for my sin.
I care not for a musing spirit,
Which leads me on to pride.
All that is high may not be holy;

“ All that is sweet—not good;

All that we want—not pure;

All that is dear to God—not pleasant;
Ι willingly accept that grace

By which 1 shall be ever found

The humbler and more timid,

More ready to give up myself.

11.

The man made learned by the gifts of grace, and scourged
by its withdraw-al into wisdom,
Will never dare to praise himself for any good,
But rather will confess
That he is poor and naked.
Give unto God that which is His,
And to yourself ascribe your own.
Give Him——the thanks due for His kindness,
Yourself alone—the blame,
And feel your punishment is owed you sor your fault.

Set yourself ever in the lowest place;
The highest shall be given you.
For the highest place means nothing unless the lowest goes
with it.
Saints highest in God's eyes
