252 TRUST FEW.

From things you do not like,

And let each have his own opinion,
Than be the slave to quarrelling words.
If you stand well with God,

Having His judgment set before you,
You will more easily endure defeat.

The Soul.
O Lord,

To what pass are we come.

See how we moan about a temporal loss,

And for a trissing gain we run about and· work;
But the soul's loss passes by and is forgottcn,
And comes back to our thoughts well nigh too late.
That which is of little use,

Or of no use, we seek after,

And that which over all is necessary

We pass by without ‘care;

Because man’s being ssows away to the external,
And if he do not quickly come unto himself

He is contented to lie there.-

How often have I found no saith

Where I thought Ι should,
And found it where I less expected it.

Vain then is hope in man ;
