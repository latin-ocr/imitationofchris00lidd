284 NA TURE'S CORRUPTION.

Stands now for vice and for the weakness of a nature
spoiled ; *

Because its movement, left unto itself, drags men to evil and
to lower things.

For the slight strength that still remained to it

Is as a spark hidden in ashes ;

Ι mean, the natural reason, folded deep in darkneSS,

Still able to discern 'twixt good and evil,

Able to separate the true and false;

Though it cannot fulfil all it approves,

Though it possesses not the Truth’s full light, nor its
affections healthy as of old.

Thus it is, O my God, that in the inner man Ι am
delighted with Thy law,
Knowing Thy bidding will be holy‚ just, and good ;
And Ι condemn all evil and siu, things to be shunned,
Yet with my ssesh Ι serve the law of sin,
Obedient to the senses, rather than to reason.

And thus it is that to will well is present in me,
But how to do it Ι cannot find.

And thus it is that I often lay a good plan down,
But as God’s kindly influence is not there to help my
weakness,
Upon a slight resistance Ι leap back, Ι fail.

And thus it is that though Ι know the way of perfect
life,
And how Ι ought to act Ι see quite clearly,
Yet, crushed beneath the weight of my corruption,
Ι (10 not rise to a more perfect path.

* These words make plain what the writer means by
“natura'’ here.
