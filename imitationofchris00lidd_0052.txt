Or even falls upon us from without,
That drags us with it in its train.

Many there are, that secretly in all they do seek their
own good ;

They know it not.

WVhen all chimes with their wishes aud their thoughts,
But if a thing be other than they like,

At once they are disturbed and sad.

And none is willing to be led

If you lean more on your own brain, on your own work,
Than on the conquering power of Jesus Christ,

Rarely and slowly will the light illumine you;

For God would have us wholly slaves to Him,

Soaring in burning love above the realms of hrain.

Or changed to works of better sort ;
