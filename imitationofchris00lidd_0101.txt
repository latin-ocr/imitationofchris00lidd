A GOOD PEACEFUL MAN. 73

Therefore first be zealous for yourself,
And then0 you may be justly zealous for your neighbour.
You know so well how to excuse your deeds,
And throw another light on them ;
Others' excuses you will not receive.
Better accuse yourself,
And set your brother free.
If you would have men bear with you,
Bear you with them.

Mar. 29. Look at true charity and humbleness of mind.
It knows not wrath nor petulance,
Save with itself ;
How far you are from that.
Living with the good and kind is nothing great.
That suits every one of course,
And every man likes quiet days,
And loves those men who think with him;
But a great gift it is, and worthy of all praise,
And a manly deed to boot,
To live at peace with men who are cross-grained. undis-
ciplined‚ and harsh.

111.

Some there are who live at peace
Both with themselves and with the world ;
And some who neither are at peace themselves,
Nor yet let others be;
A trouble unto others,
A greater trouble to themselves.
Some keep themselves in peace,
And try to bring back others too.
