14 FLIGHT FROM VAJN HOPES.

But rather in the gracious touch* of God,
Who helps the lqwly and brings down to lowliness them
that count upon themselves.

11.

Boast not in riches if you have them,
Nor in your friends that they are high in power;
But boast in God, Who gives you all,
And long's to give you, with all other things—Himself.

Pride not yourself on height or beauty,
Spoilt and made ugly by a touch of siekness.

Be not so glad about your cleverness or wit,
Lest you displease your God,
To Whom your natural goodness all belongs.

Think not yourself a better man than others,
Lest you be thought (may be) a worse one in God's sight.
He knows what lies in man.

And be'not proud of your good works;
God's judgments differ far from me11’s;
And, when men smile, He often frowns.
If you have any good in you
Believe still better things of other men.
This is the way to keep your lowly heart.
It hurts you not to place yourself behind all other men¹
But it does harm you sorely
To push yourself even in front of one.
Peace lives ever with the lowly;

But ln the proud man's heart,
Envy, and constant wrath.

'¹‘ Gratia.
