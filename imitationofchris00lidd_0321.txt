DENYJNG SELF. 289

There is my safety,

There true sanctity ;

Whatever else Ι read or hear,

Neither refreshes me nor gives me full delight.

111.

Jesus.

My son, you know all this, and you have read it all ;
11 you do it, blessed shall you be.
He that hath My commands and keepeth them,
He it is that loveth Me.
And I will love him too,
And show Myself to him,
And I will make him sit with Me in My Father's kingdom.

The Soul.

Lord Jesus, as Thy word is and Thy promise,
Let it be so to me,
And let it be my lot to gain it.
1 took, I took the cross from Thee,
1 will bear it, I will bear it to my death,
As Thou didst lay it on-me.
It is a cross, a good monk's life,
But it leads on to Paradise.
I have begun;
There must be no going back,
No leaving it.
Iit.

The Soul (speaking to others).

Oho, my brothers, go we on together,
Jesus shall be one of us.
For Him we took this cross upon uS‚
Foi· Him let us hold on.
