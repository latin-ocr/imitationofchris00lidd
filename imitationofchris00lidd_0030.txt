4 OF JMJTATJNG CHRIST.

11.
What boots it deeply of the Holy Three to talk,

If, lacking humbleness, you grieve that Holy Three ’ἓ
Deep words make no man just and holy,

But lives of virtue make men dear to God.

Far rather had 1 feel a sorrow sor my sin,

Than know the definition of the feeling;

For if in the mere letter κ’ you should know the Bible
through,

And all the sayings of the wise,

What—without love of God, without His gracious touch †
—would all be worth to you ¹?

Jan 2. “ Vanity of vanities, and all is vanity,’'
Save loving God and serving Him alone.
That is the best philosophy,
To scorn the world and strive to gain the kingdom in the
skies.
Therefore it is but vanity to seek the riches that will fail,
And to build hopes on them.
It is but vanity to look for offices of state.
It is but vanity to raise oneself on high.
lt is but vanity to follow longings of the flesh,
Panting for what must bring us heavy punishment in days
to be.
It is but vanity to wish for life that shall be long,
And care but little for its being good.
It is but vanity to think alone upon the life we lead,
And not look forward to the things which are to come.
It is but vanity to love what with all speed is passing by,
And not to hasten there where joys eternal dwell.
Jan. 3· Bethink you often of the saying,

⁰⁴ The eye is never satisfied with what it glances at,

*¹ Exterius. † Gratia.
