150 DESIRE TO TAKE CHRIST.

My only food, my only drink‚
My life, my joy,
My sweetness, all my good.

O that wholly Thou wouldst ssash Thy presence on me,
Consume and change me into Thee,

That Ι be made one spirit, I and Thou, through power of
mner union,

And through the melting inssuence of burning love.

Suffer me not to go from Thee fasting and parched‚
But do with me of Thy pity

As Thou hast often done with saints of Thine so ,

. wondrously.
What wonder if I wholly grew on fise from Thee,
My own fire dead ?
Thou art a fire that ever burns, that never fails,
A love that makes hearts pure,
And throws a ssood of light upon the mind.

CHAPTER XVII.
Burm'ng Love and F ierce Desire to T ake Christ.

The Voice of the Learner.

ITH the holiest thoughts and burning love,
With my whole heart’s affection and with fervour,
Ι long to take Thee, O my Lord,
As many saints and many pious folk have longed to take
Thee in communion,—
Men that have pleased Thee most by sanctity of life,
Men that have been most fervent in devotion.

My God, my eternal love, my good, my happiness
unending,
