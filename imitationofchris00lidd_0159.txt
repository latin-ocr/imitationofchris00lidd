THE OFFERING OF OURSELVES. 129

CHAPTER IX.

Ourselves and all we have we ought lo offer up
to God .· and we should Praysor All.

ORD The V oice of the Learner.

All is Thine

In heaven and earth.

Ι long to give myself to Thee, a free-will offering,

And be for ever Thine.

Lord, in my simple heart I give myself to-day to be Thy
servant ever,

To listen unto Thee, and be a sacrifice of everlasting
praise.

Receive me with this holy offering of Thy precious body

That I give this day to Thee,

An offering for myself

And for the safety of Thy people,

While holy angels standing by unseen look down on me.

11.

Lord, Ι offer up to Thee,
Upon Thy shrine that makes amends for all,
All my misdeeds and sins,
That Ι have done before Thee and the holy angels,
From the day I first began to sin even till now;
That Thou shouldst burn them all alike, and with Thy

charitable fire consume them,

Wiping away the spots of all my evil acts,
Clearing my conscience clean of every speck,
And giving back to me Thy favour, lost by sin;
Granting me full indulgence,
Taking me up with pity for the kiss of peace.
