60 WISH TO BETTER ALL OUR LIVES.

Not practising the things to which they have been called.
How hurtful to neglect the plan of our profession,
And turn our thoughts to what does not concern them.

111.

Remember then your purposed plan of life,
Putting the image of the Crucified before you.
You look upon the life of Christ and well may be ashamed
That you have not tried more to make yourself like Him,
Though you have long been walking on the path of God.
The monk whose practice lies
In the most holy life and passion of the Lord
Will find in it abundance for his uses and his wants,
Nor does he need to ask for what is better
Outside the life of Him.
O ifJesus on the cross did but come into our hearts,
How soon we should be learned, and how learned we

should be.

The zealous monk
Bears and takes well
All that is bidden him.
The careless monk, and lukewarm,
Meets sorrow upon sorrow,
Trouble on trouble,
Misery on every side,
Because he is without the inward comfort in his soul,
And he is not allowed to look for comfort from the world.
The monk who lives outside his rule,
Leaves the way open to a dreadful fall.
The monk who seeks a laxer and an easier life
Will always be in trouble,
For one thing or another will be always then displeasing
him.
