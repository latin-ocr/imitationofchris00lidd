THOUGHTS ΟΝ OURSELVES. 75

You would see all things clear, nothing between,
And you would understand them all ς

And a pure heart

Sees right inside—-to heaven and hell.

As each man is within,
So he judges all that is without.
If in the world joy anywhere exists‚
1t is the pure in heart that own it;
If sorrow and heaviness be anywhere,
The evil conscience knows them well.

Mar. 31. As iron, when thrust into the ssame,
Loses its rust,
And turns to glowing white,
So he who wholly turns to God puts off his sluggish ways,
And changes to another man.
When man begins to cool,
He fears a little toil,
And gladly welcomes comfort from without.
But when we really gain the victory,
And walk like men upon the way of God,
Then we think little of the things
That once we felt so hard.

CHAPTER V.
Thouglzts on Onrselves.

April ¹· E cannot much rely upon ourselves,
Because God's favour and our own powers often
fail us.

Our light is dim,
And even this we soon neglect and lose.
Often we do not see
That in our hearts we are so blind.
