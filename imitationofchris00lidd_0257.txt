HELP DIVINE. 225

This it is that most of all stands in the way of heavenly

comfort,

That you corne so slowly to your prayers.

For before you ask Me earnestly,

In the meantime you look for many a solace;

You feed yourself on things without,

And therefore all is little use to yon,

Until you turn to Me: for I am He who raises those who
hope in Me,

And outside Me is no help worth the name,

No useful counsel,

And no lasting cure.

But now the storm is gone; take breath again,
And in My pity's light come back to health;
For I am near, saith the Lord,
Making all things right again,
Nay, even increasing them, and adding blessings to them.
Is aught hard to Me ¹?
Am Ι like one that speaks and will not do ἰ)
Where is your saith ’.Ρ
Stand firm,
And persevere;
Be longsuffering,

Be brave ;
Comfort shall come to you in its own time.

Wait for Me, wait for Me,
And I will come and heal.

11.

'Tis temptation that annoys you,
'Tis empty dread that makes you sear.
What matters anxious care about the things that may come
some day ’.Ρ
It only brings sorrow on sorrow.
