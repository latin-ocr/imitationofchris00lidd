FOUR THINGS THAT BRING PEACE. 213

Yet much perfection in them lies;

Short to be said,

But full of meaning, rich in fruit.

If they could only be kept faithfully by me,

Disturbing thoughts would not so lightly rise.

For, when I am not at rest, in heaviness,

I find I have gone back from this Thy teachiug.

But Thou that canst do all, and ever lovest the profit of
the soul,

Add greater grace to me,

That I may fill the measure of Thy wordS,

And perfect my salvation.

11.
A Pmyer against Evz'l T lzouglzts.
Sept. 19· Lord God, go not far from me,
Look on me to my help 3
For many musing thoughts, great fears, rise up in me,
Beating against my soul.

How can I pass through all unhurt ’.Ρ
How break their bond Ρ

(The Voice of God, answering.)
I, saith He, will go before you,
And will lay low the boasters of the world,
Opening the prison doors,
Lifting the veil from secret mysteries.

(T [ιε Prayer goes on.)

Do, Lord, as Thou sayest,
And from Thy face ssy every evil thought 3
My hope, my only comfort, is
To ssy to Thee in time of trouble ;
To trust in Thee,
To call upon Thee from my inmost heart,
And quietly to wait for Thy consoling power.
