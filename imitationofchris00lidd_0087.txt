WISH TO BETTER ALL OUR LJVES. 61

How do so many other monks get on,
Close kept within the cloister's rule,
Coming out but now and then,

Living in contemplation,

Eating but sparingly ’.Ρ

Their dress is rough ;

Their toil is great;

Their words are sew;

Their vigils long;

Their sleep is short ;

They pray their prayers ever and again3
And they are always reading ;

Keeping themselves in all their order's discipline.

See the Carthusians and Cistereians,*
The monks and nuns of many another order ;
See how they rise up every night
To sing their psalms to God,
And it would be a shame that you
Should grow so sluggish in your holy work,
When such a number of good souls
Begin to sing their songs to Him.
Mar. 19· O that there was nothing to be done
But praise our God and Lord with heart and voice:
Ο that you never felt the need to eat aud drink and sleep,
And that you could be always blessing Him,
Spending your time in what is helpful to the soul.
Then you would be happier far than now,
When you are but the slave to something that the body
needs.
O would to God these needs did not exist,
That there were no food wanted but the soul's,
Which we, alas, taste only now and then.
