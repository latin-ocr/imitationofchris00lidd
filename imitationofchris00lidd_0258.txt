226 HELP DIVINE.

Let the day’s trouble be enough for it;

lt is a vain and useless thing to be disturbed or glad about
the things to come;

May be they never come.

But 'tis like man to be deceived by phantoms such as
this;

It is the mark of minds yet weak,

So lightly to be led at the suggestion of the enemy.

For he cares not whether he deludes and cheats you with
false words or with true,

Whether he lays you low with love of what you see,

Or with fear of all that is to come.

Let not your beart be troubled,

Neither let it be afraid.

Believe in Me,

And in My pity trust.

When you fancy you are very far from Me,

Often I am quite near.

When you think all well-nigh lost,

Closer follows your reward—a larger boon.

All is not lost

When things go contrary.

Judge not according to your present thought ;

Receive not, cling not unto any trouble, whencesoe’er it
comes,

As though all hope were gone of rising from the wave.

Think not that you are wholly desolate,

Though for a time Ι may have sent you tribulati0n‚

Or taken away the comfort that you longed for.

For thus we pass unto the kingdom of the skies.

And doubtless it is well for you and all My saints
To be tried by crosses,
And not have all things well.
