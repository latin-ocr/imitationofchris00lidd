How osten they were troubled hy the foe,

How frequent and how burning were the prayers
They offered up to God;

How hard their fasts,

How great the zeal and love upon their holy path,

How brave the fight they fought to tame the spirit of its
faults,

How pure and straight their aim upon their way to God.

By day they toiled,
Bv night they kept time free for lengthened orisons,
And even while they toiled they never stopped the mental
prayer ; ’
All their days passed usefully,
Every hour seeming too short for God ;
· And for the great delight in meditation,
The body's wants were often clean forgotten.

All wealth and dignity,
All honours, friends, and kinsfolk they renounced;
They longed for nothing srom the world,—
Scaree did they take necessities for life,
Grieving to serve the body even in its needs.

So they were poor in earthly riches,—p00r to the world
outside,

But they were very rich in grace and virtue,
Resreshed within with grace and comfort from on high.

Strangers to the world,
They were neighbours and familiar friends to God.
To themselves they seemed as nothing,
Of this world they were despised
But they were rare and lovely in the eyes of God.
They lived in true humility3
Simply obedient,
