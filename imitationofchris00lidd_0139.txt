REVERENCE IN TAKING CHRIST. 109

IV.

Many run far and wide to see the relies os the saintS,
And marvel at their deeds of which they hear,
And at the generous building of the shrines ;
They gaze within and kiss the sacred bones,
Wrapped up in silk and gold.
And lo, Thou art here with me on the altar,*

O my God, Holy of Holies,
Author of men and lord of angels.

Osten in such sights

There is but curiosity,

And something new that has not yet been seen ς

And little fruit, little improvement,

Do men bring back with them,

WVhere, without true contrition, they run so lightly here and
there.

But at the sacramental altar Thou art wholly present,

My God, Christ Jesus‚ Man.

There too, abundant fruit, salvation everlasting, may be
seen,

As oft as Thou art worthily and piously received.

Unto this shrine no man is drawn

By fickle, sensual, curious thoughts,

But by pure saith, by holy hope, by charity sincere.

V.

O God, the hidden Maker of the world,

How wondrously Thou workest with us.

How gently and how graciously Thou dealest with Thy
chosen ones,

Putting Thyself before thern to be taken in Thy sacrament„

For this outruns all understanding,

* He is contrasting the saints with God.
