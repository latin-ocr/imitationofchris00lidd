90 GRA TI T UDE FOR GOD’S KINDNESS.

Are lowest in their own ;

The greater their humility,

The more their glory.

Full of the truth and heavenly brightness,
They want no empty fame.

Stablishcd and firm in God,

They can in no way be puffed up.

And they who give to Hi1n

All that they have received of good

Seek no glory from each other,

Wishing for that which comes from God alone;
And they would have Him praised

In them and all the saints,

And ever to this aim they tend.

Be thankful then for smallest gists,

And you will thus be worthy of the greater.
Account the smallest as the great,

And the more worthless as a special benefit.
If you regard the dignity of Him who gives,
No gift seems small or cheap;

For that cannot be small

That comes from God Almighty.

Though He may send you stripes and punishment,
It should be pleasant;

For all that He allows to come to us

He does to work the safety of our souls. ’

The man who longs to keep the touch* of God,
Let him be thankful for it when it comes;
And when it goes, wait patiently,
Praying sor its return,
Careful and humble lest he lose it.

* Gratia.
