EXAMI’LES SET US BV HOLVFATHERS. 3¹

Yon have been called, you know, to suffer and to work,
And not to gossip and to doze.

As in the burning surnace gold is tried,

Here are men tried;

And no one’s feet are firm,

Unless with all his heart he strives to live

Willingly humble sor the love of God.

CHAPTER XVIII.

Examples set us by tlze Holy F athers.

'Feb 8. ΟΟΚ on the vivid patterns set us by the saints,
In whom religion and true holiness
Shone like a beacon—light.
What then is all we do ’.Ρ-
Trivial or naught.
What is this life of ours‚
Put against theirs Ῥ

Behold the saints, the friends of Christ,
Serving the Lord in hunger and in thirst,
In nakedness and cold,
In hours of watchfulness and days of fast,
In prayer and holy thought,
In many insults and in persecution.
How great the ills they suffered, and how many,—
AposUes, Martyrs‚ Virgins, and Confessors,
And all who wished to follow in the steps of Christ ;
For in this world they hated their own souls,
That they might keep them to eternal life.

Feb. 9, How strict‚ how sels-forgetful were the lives
The holy fathers in the desert lived 3
How long the trials they went through, how stern ς
