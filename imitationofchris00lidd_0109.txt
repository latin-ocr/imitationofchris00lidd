LOVE OF JESUS ABOVE ALL. 79

God on the heart;
Man muses on the deeds‚
God weighs the motives.

It is a sign that a man's soul is lowly,

If he do always well and yet puts little value on himself.

lt is a sign of purity and inward confidence

To want no comfort from created things.

The man who wants no proof from the outer world to help
him on

Has, it is clear, trusted himself to God.

“ He is not approved,'' says blessed Paul, “who lauds
himself,

‘⁴ But he whom God approves.”

within—a walk with God;

Without—no tie to any;

This is the inward life.

CHAPTER VII.
Love ofsesus above All.

APPY the man who knows what loving Jesus means,
Scorning himself for Jesus' sake.
We must leave what we love for Him we love,
For Jesus would be loved alone and above all.
Affection for created things is weak and treacherous;
But love for Him is faithful and will last.
He that to the creature clings
Shall fall with what is srail.
He that throws his arm round Jesus
Shall grow for ever stronger.

11.
Love Him, keep Him as your friend;
He will not leave you when all others ξος
