OUTWARD THINGS. 251

One learnt the lesson of God‚*
And spoke wondrous things,
By intimate love of Me ;

More profiting in leaving all
Than in the study of subtleties.

But unto some Ι speak words fit for all; to others special

words;

To some I sweetly show Myself in signs and figures;

For some I tear the veil from mysteries in ssoods of light.

There is one voice in books‚† and yet they teach not
all men equally,

Because I am within them, the Truth‚ the Teacher, looking
closely at the heart, knowing the thoughts,

Leading on to action,

Dealing to each as I deem fit.

CHAPTER XLIV.1
No mez'ng to Ourselves of Outward leings.

God.

Nov. 7. Y Son, v
In much you must be ignorant,

And count yourself as dead upon the earth,
And one to whom the world is crucified.
Much you must pass by with deadened ear,
And rather think
On what is for your peace.
Better for you to turn your eyes away

'¹‘ Is he thinking of himself?

ἢ· That is, in the books read by the Brotherhood.

Σ This chapter and the next are written in by a later and
clumsier hand. The rest of the MS. is in Thomas Kempis'

own handwritin g.
