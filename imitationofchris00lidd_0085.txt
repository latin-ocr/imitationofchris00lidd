WJSH TO BETTER ALL OUR LIVES. 59

Who make most progress on the road of piety.

For then a man gets greater good,

Wins fuller favoiir,*

When he kills his passion and gains the day over himself.
All men have not like sins to conquer and to kill;

Yet the careful zealous soul

Will be the stronger on his path,

Though he have more to overcome,

Than he of well-conducted ways

Who is less zealous to be good.

Two things above all others help to great improvement

on the road ;

The first, to take yourself away with violence

From all that nature wickedly inclines to ;

And next—the more you need the good, the more to press
on towards it;

A third, to guard against and overcome

All that is wont to grate on you in others.

Look to your progress everywhere,
That if you see or hear of a good pattern set
You may be straight on fire to copy it ;
But, if you think of anything as shameful,
Beware—for you may do the same,
And even if you may have done it once and yet again,
Try the sooner to improve.
Just as your eye sees other men,
So in your turn you are by others watched.

How sweet and pleasant to behold a brotherhood
zealous and devout,
Men of good character—living their rule
How hard and sad to see men wandering from the path,

*⁸ Gratiam.
