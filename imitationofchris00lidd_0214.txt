182 REFER ALL TO GOD.

CHAPTER IX.

All lez’rzgs must be Rcserred to God as to the
Fz'nal End.

God.

Y son,

I ought to be your last, your final end,
If you would be happy.
With this before your mind your love shall be made pure,
That is too often bent upon itself
And turned unto created things.
For if you seek yourself,
At once you fail, and become dry.

Refer then everything to Me as to a beginning.
I gave you all.

Look upon everything
As flowing from the highest good.
To Me then, as its source, must everything be brought.

11.

From Me the weakling and the great,
The poor and rich,
As from a living fountain draw new life ;
And those who serve Me freely, willingly‚
Shall receive one kindness on another ;*
But he who will be glorified apart from Me,
And will delight himself in any private good,
Shall not be firinly stablished in real j0y,

*⁸ Cf. S. John i. 16. Is it too late, though the Revised
Version has been issued, to protest against the mistranslation
which speaks of “grace sor grace '’'? The phrase means “a
continual recurrence of kindnessoest’
