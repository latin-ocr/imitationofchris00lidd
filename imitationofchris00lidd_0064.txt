38 LOVE OF SOLJTUDE AND SILENCE.

And idly going here and there,
From hearing all the gossip and the news,

You will find time enough, and time well-fitted too,
To muse on what is good.

The greatest saints avoided, when they could,
Solace from men,

And chose to serve God in the cell.

And one has said,
â€œOsten as I walked with men,
Less os a man did I return.''
Again and yet again we see,
When we keep chattering,
That it is easier wholly to be dumb
Than not to step beyond the line in talk3
That it is easier to stay quietly at home
Than to keep guard over ourselves abroad.

He then who would attain the inner holier life
Must draw away, as Jesus did, a little from the crowd.

11.

No man is safe walking abroad,
Unless he loves obscurity at home.
No man is safe in speech,
Unless he loves the quiet tongue.
No man is safe in power,
Unless he loves the lower place.
No man is safe in places of command,
Unless the lesson of obedience is learnt.

No man is safe in joy,
Unless he have within a conscience that is good,

The witness of his life.
