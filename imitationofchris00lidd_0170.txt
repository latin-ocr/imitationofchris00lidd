That, worthily and loyally, with conscience good and in
all purity, we may serve 35 household slaves ;
And if we cannot pass our lives so innocently 35 we would,

Grant us at least to moan with worthy penitence over the
evils we have done,

And with a humble mind and a good will to serve Thoe
with more zeal on the rcmainder of our path,

CHAPTER ΧΙΙ.

The Voice of the Beloved.

I AM a lover of purity,
Giver of all holiness.
I ask for 3 clean heart—
leat is My resting-place.
Prepare for Me a large room ready furnished,

And I and My disciples will make our paschal feast with
you.

If you will that I should come to you,

And stay with you,

Purge the old ferment out,

Make clean the habitation of the heart,

Bar out the world and all the din of vices,
Sit like the sparroxv lonely on the housetop,

And muse on all you do amiss in bitterness of soul;
For everyone that loves

Makes ready for the lover 3 fair and beauteous place;
By this is known the love of one receiving his beloved.

But know
That not by any merit of your own,
