HUMBLE THOUGHTS OF SELF. 5

The ear is never filled with what it hears,”
And try to wean your heart from loving what you see,
And turn to what you cannot 566 ;

For they who follow where the senses lead, will spoil the
consclence,

And lose the kindly touch* of God.

CHAPTER II.

Humble T lzouglzts of Selfi

Jan. ὅ· ALL men by nature dearly love to know,
But knowledge without sear of God—what is it
worth P
Better indeed a humble peasant, fearing God,
Than the proud thinker who neglects himself in musing
on the courses of the stass.
He that well knows himself is cheap in his own sight,
And praise from man delights him not;
For if I knew all that is in the world,
And yet were not in charity with men,
What would it profit me before my God ἲ
He is to judge me from my actions here.

Rest, rest from this excessive longing;
In it you will but find distraction and deceit.
Gladly the men of knowledge would seem wise,
Gladly be talked of as “the learned;''
But there are many things

Of little or no profit to the soul.
Unwise indeed is he

Who turns his mind to aught
But that which serves the safcty of his soul.

⁸⁸ Gratia.
