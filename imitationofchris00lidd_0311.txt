TWO VJEWS OF LIFE. 279

F ights with sels-indulgence,

Asks for subjection,

VVishes for defeat,

Cares not for its own liberty,

Loves to be bound by rule,

Likes not to domineer,

But ever under God

To live, to stand, to be;

And for His sake is ready humbly to bow down
To any human creature.

The life of man works for its own end,
And thinks, “ What can 1 gain from some one else ’ἓ ”

Lise touched by God cares not what serves or helps itself,
But what will help mankind.

The life of man is glad to be held high of men, and
reverenced ;

Lise touched by God gives honestly to Him all glory and
all honour.

⁶²⁶ · The life of man fears scorn and dreads a blush;

Life touched by God smiles at an insult for the name of
Jesus.

The life of man loves rest and quiet for the body3
Life touched by God cannot be wasting time,
But hugs toil joyfully.

ec · The life of man runs aster fair and curious things,

Shudders at the sordid and the gross;

Life touched by God is pleased with what is plain and
simple,

Looks not roughly ou the rough,

And does not mind wearing old ragS.

The life of man is always looking on the things of time,
Pleased with the pelf os earth,
