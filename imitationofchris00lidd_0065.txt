LOVE OF SOLITUDE AND SILENCE. 39

Yet mark. This safety of the saints existed not
Without a thorough sear of God,
And no less anxious, no less humble, were they in
themselves
For all the shining glory os their virtues and their grace.
But for the fancied safety of the bad,
lt springs srom sels-conceit and pride,
And at the last it turns and proves,
Even to itself, how false it is.

Brother, good as you may seem,—
Hermit‚ pious as you are,—
Never in this life boast yourself that you are safe;
For often those who stood high in the thoughts of men
Have been in graver peril from their very confidence.
So it does good to many a man
Not to go scot free of trials,
But that they often should assault the fortress of the soul3
For sear men get too sure,
For fear men be set high upon the towers of pride,
For sear they turn too lightly
To the consoling voices from without.

Ο if a man would never seek the joys that pass so
quickly by,
If he would never worry with the world,
How good his inward heart would be;
If he would cut but clean and deep
Into the wound of empty cares,—
If he would only think of what is wholesome
And of what comes from heaven,—
If he would lay the corner-stone of all his life in God,
How great would be the treasure of his peaceful rest.
