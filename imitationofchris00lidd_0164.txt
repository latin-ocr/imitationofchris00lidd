134 FORBEAR NOT COMMUNJON.

Nay: it is very hurtful to put off and off,
lt brings on men a heavy sleep.

How sad it is that souls cold and inconstant are only
glad to make delays iu their confession,
And for this very reason would defer it,
That they may not be bound to keep a closer watch upon
themselves.

How slow their charity, how weak their holy thoughts,
Postponing it so easily.

How happy he, how dear to God,
Who lives a life so good, and keeps such pure watch on
his inner sels,
As to be ready and well pleased
To take communion every day,
If he were unmarked of others,
And if it were suffered him.

When now and then a man keeps back from humbleness,
or for some good reason in his way,

Praise him for reverence3

But if torpor creeps across his path,

He should arouse himself, and do what in him lies ;

God will be there to grant him the good will;

That above all he looks for.

But when he is duly hindered,

He will never lose that will ;

He will devoutly mean to take the sacrament,

Nor will he miss the benefit.

For any pious soul may every day, ay, everywhere, with
health unto himself and unsorbidden, come to a mental
communion with Christ.

And yet on certain days and at fixed times,

He should receive with loving reverence
