REVERENCE IN TAKJNG CHRIST. 107

Wherein to put the tables of Thy law;
And Ι, a being of decay, shall I so lightly‘dare to take Thee,
Founder of the law, Giver of life ⁴?

solomon, the wisest of all Israel’s kings, built for seven
years a gorgeous temple

To the honour of Thy- name ;

And for eight days held its dedication feast,

Offering a thousand victims for his peace;

And with the blare of trumpets and with joy, in all
solemnity‚ brought to its destined place the
covenantal ark,—

And 1, unhappy, poorest among men, how shall Ι bring

Thee to my home Ῥ-
Ι, that can scarce spend half an hour in holy thought;
Ι wish that Ι could look on one half hour spent well.

11.

Oh my God, how hard they strove to please Thee;
Ah, how weak is all Ι do.
How short a time Ι take
When I prepare for my communion.
Rarely are my thoughts drawn quite to one ;
Rarely‚ if ever, am I purged from all distracting cares.
And yet Ι know
That when Thy saving deity is near me,
No unbecoming thought should flit across me,
And no created thing should hold my mind;
For I am to welcome to the inn
No angel, but the angels’ Lord.

Yet there is a distance great enough
Between the ark and all its treasures,
And Thy pure body with its nameless powers;
