280 TWO VIEWS OF LIFE.

Gloomy at loss,

Pricked by the least injurious word ;

Life touched by God looks on the eternal,-
With it no cleaving unto tirne,

No frown when property is lost,

No sneer when words are harsh,—

Because it puts its treasure and its joy in heaven,
Where nothing fades.

The life of man is covetous, and gladly gets more than it
gives,
Loving its own, its private store;
Life touched by God is good, ready to share,
Shuns ‘⁴ property,'' and is content with little,
Thinking it more blessed to give than to receive.

The life of man turns to creation and to the ssesh it loves,
To empty vanity and runnings here and there;
Life touched by God leads man to Him and to the virtues,
Gives up creation, shuns the world,
Hates the body’s lusts,
Puts a bit on wandering fancies‚*
Blushes to appear abroad.

The life of man is glad to get at comfort from without,
to get a pleasure it can feel ,ζ
Life touched by God looks only unto Him for consolation,
For pleasure in the highest good, far above all that it can
see.

The life of man does all for gain, for its own good,

Never does anything for nothing,

But longs to get an equal boon, perhaps a greater one,

Or praise and kindness for the good it does.

It wants its own deeds, gists, and words to be thought

much of in the scale.
