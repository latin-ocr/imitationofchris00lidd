JESUS, OUR FAMILJAR FRIEND. 81

CHAPTER VIII.

Jesch, Our Familiar Frz'end.

April 8. ESUS near—all is well;
Nothing seems difficult.
When He is absent,
All is hard.

When He does not speak in us,
Comfort is worthless 3
But if He speaks one word,
Great is the comfort felt.
Did she not nse, Mary of Magdala, from where she wept,
At Martha‘s word, “Here is the Master calling thee '’‘1‘
Happy the hour
When jesus calls you from your tears to joy of heart.
How patched, how hard you are without Him;
How empty and unwise
If you want anything beyond Him.
Would not the loss of Him be greater loss
Than if the whole world went from you.
What, without Him‚ can it give you?
Apart from Him, life is a grievous hell;
With Him, a pleasant garden.
If He be with you,
No enemy can hurt you.
He who finds Jesus
Finds a treasure rare,
A jewel above all others.
And he who loses Him is losing, ah, so much,
Much more than all the world.
Without Him man is but a beggam
With Him, a prince.
