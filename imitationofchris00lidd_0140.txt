110 REVERENCE IN TAKJNG CHRISTI

This above all draws pious hearts to Thee; this kindles
love;

For Thy true faithful ones,

Who all their lives give themselves up

Unto the mending of their faults,

From the most worthy sacrament often receive

Devotion's graee,* and love of what is good.

VI.

O sacramental power secret and wonderful,
Known only to the faithful ones of Christ.
Unfaithful souls and slaves of sin can know thee not.
In thee is held *all spiritual grace;
By thee the virtue that was lost is quickened in the soul ;
And beauty, fouled by sin, returns to her.
Sometimes this grace is such
That, from the fulness of devotion gathered there, not the

mind only, but the feeble body feels fuller power
bestowed on it.

VII.

Yet we are lukewarm and neglectful, and we must weep

and wail,

That with no greater love we are led on to take up Christ,

Christ the whole hope and merit of those that would be
saved.

He it is Who makes us holy; He it is Who ransoms us
for God.

He is our comfort on ourjourney, and the saints' eterna] joy.

Weep, weep, that many men turn them so little to this
saving mystery,

That makes heaven glad,

And keeps in being the universal world.

* That is, the power to bc devout.
