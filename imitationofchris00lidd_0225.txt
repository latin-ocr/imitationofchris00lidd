GOD'S SECRET JUDGMENTS. 193

Wisdom worthless,

If Thou hold not the helm

Bravery of no avail,

If Thou preserve us not.

Chastity unsafe,

If Thou protect it not.

Self-watching useless,

If Thou keep not Thy sacred vigil near us,
cht to ourselves, we sink, we die ;
When Thou art near, we rise, we live.
Unstable, yet by Thee made strong;
Lukewarm‚ yet set on fire by Thee,

With what humility and lowliness I ought to think upon

myself,

And weigh as nothing any good Ι seem to have.

How deep 1 ought to sink down in the waves of Thine
unfathomable judgments,

When I find that I am nothing else

But nothing, nothing.

How past all measure is the weight,

How past all crossing is the ocean,

When 1 find nothing in myself,

The whole of me but nothing.

Where then may glory find a place to hide in,
Or pride blown from conceit ’.Ρ
Swallowed is all empty boasting in the wave‚
In the deep wave Thy judgments have rolled over me,
What is all ssesh before Thee,
And shall clay boast itself against the moulder of it ’.Ρ

How can a man rise high through empty speech
Whose heart is of a truth bowed down to God t>
