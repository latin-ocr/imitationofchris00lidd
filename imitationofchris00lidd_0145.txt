GOOD TO COMMUNICATE OFTEN. 115

CHAPTER III.
It is a Usefztl Τ lzz'ng often to take tlze Sacrament.

The Voice of the Learner.

EE, Ι am coming to Thee, Lord,
That it may be well with me according to Thy gift,

And that 1 may be joyful in the holy feast
Which Thou, God, hast prepared
In Thy sweet mercy for the poor.
In Thee is all Ι can or ought to need,
My safety and my ransom,
My life, my strength,
My glory and my honour.

Therefore to-day rejoice Thy servant's soul,
“For to Thee, Lord Jesu, have Ι list up my soul.”
Now piously and reverently would Ι take Thee,
And I would bring Thee to my home,

And, with Zacchaeus,* win a blessing of Thee,
And be reckoned among Abraham’s sons,

My soul lusts to take Thy body;

My heart would be made one with Thee.

Give me Thyself and 'tis enough,

For, without Thee, no comfort is of use to me.

Away from Thee Ι cannot be,
Without Thy visiting me I cannot live 3
And Ι must often come to Thee,

And take Thee for the medicine of my health,†
That Ι fail not on my way,

Robbed of my food from heaven.

* Zachaeus, MS.
† In remedium salutis meae.
