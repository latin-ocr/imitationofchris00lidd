30 LIFE IN THE MONASTERY.

CHAPTER XVII.

sze in the Monaslery.

feb. ⁶· EEDS must you leam to break yoursell in pieces
many a time,
If you would be at rest with other men,

And have your heart knit unto theirs.
No little thing it is to dwell with monks or in a brotherhood,

And there pass in and out without a word of blame,

And faithfully live out your life even to death.

Blessed is he who in one spot has lived a life of good,
And gathered up the fragments of his days in happiness*

If you would stand as you should stand,
If you would tread where you should tread‚
Then must you think yourself a banished man, a wanderer

on the earth;
If you would lead a holy life,
You must be thought a fool for Christ.
Little the profit in the gown or shaven head3
It is the change of life that makes us holy,
The passions killed never to rise again.

11.

Ft’b· 7· He who seeks aught but God alone,

And safety for his soul,
Will find but grief and tribulation here3

Nor can that man stand long in peace
Who will not try to be the least,
And servant unto all.

It is for service you are here ;
Not for a throne.

* Et feliciter consummaverit.
