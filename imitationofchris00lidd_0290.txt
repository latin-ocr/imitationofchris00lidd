258 TRUST [Ν GOD.

Whatever comes to him from God ;

And though an unjust charge be brought against him,

Will not care much ;

Nor will he shout in empty joy,

If others sensibly aequit him of it.

For he considers how that I am He that looks into the
heart and reins,

And often in My eyes that is condemned

Which men think fit to praise.

11.
The Soul.

Nov. Ῐ5- Lord God, just Judge, brave and longsuffering

W ho knowest the frailty and wickedness of men,

Be my protection, all my trust ;

My conscience fails me.

Thou knowest what Ι (10 not know.

Therefore‚ when blamed, I should have humbled sels and
borne it quietly,

And, often as I have not,

Pardon me in Thy mercy;

And give me grace to bear more suffering another time.

For Thine abundant pity gives more hope for pardon,

Than when my conscience does not speak, and I hold up
my own ideas ofjustice ;'¹¹‘

And if I know of no wrong done,

Yet in that Ι cannot justify myself ;

Because, without Thy pity, ‘⁴ none that lives shall be called
just before Thee.'’

* Melior est enim mihi tua copiosa misericordia ad consecu-
tionem indulgentiae
Quam mea opinata justitia pro defensione latentis conscientiae.
(Evcn the voice of conscience is not strong enough to tell us
of our saults.)
