ROYAL PATHWAY OF THE HOLY CROSS. 99

IV.

Mayz. When you have corne to this, that cares are sweet, and,
borne for Christ, taste pleasantly,
Then think it well with y0u;
For you have found an Eden on the earth.
So long as it is hard to suffer and you try to shun it,
So long will you be ill at ease,
And everywhere the cross you shun shall follow you.
1f you set yourself to what you should,—
Ι mean, to suffer and to die,—
Things will get better soon, and you will find your peace.

Though you be rapt to the third heaven with Paul,

You are not, therefore, sure that you will never suffer
things that go against you.

Saith Jesus, “I will show him

What he must suffer for My sake.”

Suffering then will stay by you,

If you would love Him, and for ever be His slave.

O would that you were worthy to endure for Jesus' name.

How loud would be the shout among the saints of God 3

How large the progress in your neighbour's life;

For all praise suffering,

Though few can bear it.

But it were only reason that you should suffer for Christ a
little,

When many suffer worse things for the world.

May ³- Be sure of this, V·

That you must lead a dying life.

The more a man dies to himself,

The more will he begin to live to God.

No one is fit to understand the things of heaven,
Unless He brings himself to bear adversity for Christ.
