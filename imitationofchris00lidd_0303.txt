IN THE HANDS OF GOD. 271

Bringing pain and agony on me within, without.
None there is of all the creatures mider heaven that can
console me,

But Thee, O Lord my God, heavenly physician of the soul,
Who strikest deep and healest me,

Bringest me down to hell and raisest up again.
Thy training is over me,
Thy rod itself shall teach me.

See, loving Father‚ in Thine hands Ι am,
I bow beneath the rod of Thy correction.
Strike my back, my neck,
That Ι may bend my wayward steps unto Thy will.
Make me a good and humble follower as Thou wast wont
to do,

That I may walk quite at Thy nod.
Ι yield myself and all Ι have to Thee to be corrected ;
Better to be punished now than afterwards.

Thou knowest all and each,
And nothing in the human conscience can escape Thee.
Before they are, Thou knowest what will come;
Need there is none that one should tell or warn Tliee of
the things on earth.
Thou knowest what is best to help me on my way,
And what the use os trial is to clear the rust of sin.
Do with me according to Thy pleasure; it is mine ;
My sinful life do not despise,
A life known unto none so well, so clearly as to Thee.

Grant me, O Lord, to know what should be known,
To leave what should be left,
To praise what best likes Thee,
To think on all that seems of price to Thee.,
And to blame all that in Thy sight is toul.
