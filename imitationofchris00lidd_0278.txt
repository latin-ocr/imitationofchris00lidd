246 ΝΟ GOOD IN SELF.

Truly empty glory is an evil pest,

The chief of vanities,

That draws us from the glory that is true
And robs us of the grace of heaven.

Man pleases self, displeases God.
Gaping to swallow human praise,

He robs himself of real virtues.

It is true glory, holy exultation‚
To boast in Thee and not in self,
In Thy name to rejoice,

Not in one’s own worth,

And in no created thing to take our pleasure‚ but in Thee.

Praise to Thy name,
Not mine;
Thy work be glorified,
Not mine;
Thy holy name be blessed, ,
And nothing of the praise of man set down to me.
Thou art my glory‚ Thou the exultation of my heart ;
In Thee Ι will exult and boast myself the livelong day;
But in myself for nothing,
Save for my weaknesses.

111.

Let Jews require the glory given by men to one another,
Ι will ask that which comes from God alone.
All from man,
All honour of the world,
All lofty places there,
Set over against Thine everlasting glory,
Are but vanity and folly.
My Truth, my Pity, and my God, O Blessed Trinity,
To Thee alone be praise and honour, virtue, fame,
Through the unending ages of the ages.
