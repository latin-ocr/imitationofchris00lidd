72 A GOOD PEACEFUL MAN.

11.

It is the humble man that God defends and frees;
It is the humble man He loves and comforts.
To the humble man He bends,
To the humble man He gives abundance of His favour.
And when he is cast down, He lifts him up to glory.
To the humble man He shows His secrets,
And sweetly draws him to Himself, and bids him come.
The humble man, though he may meet with shame,
Is yet well enough at peace,
Because he stands on God, not on the world.
Think not that you have profited a whit
Unless you feel yourself lower than all.

CHAPTER ΙΙΙ.

Α Good Peacqful Man.

IRST keep yourself at peace;

Then you can quiet others.
The peaceful man is of more use
Than the great doctor.
The passionate turn even good to bad,
Lightly believing evil.
The peaceful man turns everything to good.
The man at peace
Never suspects,
But the disturbed and discontented soul
Is tossed by many a suspicions thought.
Not still himself,
Nor suffering others to be still,
often he says what he should not;
Osten he leaves what should be done,
Neglects his duty,
Musing on all that other men are bound to do.
