BEARING INJURIES. 201

That Thou didst deign to show me and all faithful souls
A straight way and a good to Thine eternal kingdom.
Thy life is ours;

By holy patience we press on to Thee, our crown.
Didst Thou not go before and teach us,

Who would care to follow ’.Ρ

How far away, how far behind, men would remain,
Did they not see Thy bright example.

Look, we still are cool,

After so many wonders told us, after so much teaching
heard;

What would it be
If we had not a light like Thee to follow Ῥ

CHAPTER XIX.

Beart'ng Injuries—the Really Patz'ent Man-
tlte Proos qf It.

M Y son, what is it you are saying ’.Ρ
Stop your complaints,

Look on My sufferings and the sufferings of the saints—-
You have not yet “ resisted unto blood.⁷’

Little enough is all you suffer,

Set against those that have endured so much,

Have been so greatly tempted,

So fiercely tried,

So often proved and exercised.

You should bethink you of their greater sufferings‚

That you may lightly bear your trissing ones 3
And if they seem not trissing to you,
See that it is not your impatience.
