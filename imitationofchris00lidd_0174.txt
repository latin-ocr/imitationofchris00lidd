144 ΗΜΘΝ WJJH CHRIST.

11.

How kind Thy Spirit, oh my Lord.
To show Thy swectness to Thy sons
Thou deignest to refresh them with the pleasant bread
that comes from heaven.

No other nation is in truth so great that it should have

gods near to it,

As Thou, our God, art near to all Thy faithful souls,

To whom T hou givest Thyself to be eaten and enjoyed—

A comfort on the daily road, a lifting of the heart to heaven.

What other nation is so famous as the Christian common-
wealth ’.Ρ

What thing beneath the sky so loved as is the pious soul,

To whom God comes, to seed it with His glorious ssesh ⁷?

Ο kindness past the power of speech,
O condescension wonderful,
O love beyond all measure, spent alone on man·

But what am I to give Thee for this kindness,
For charity so excellent?
Nothing more grateful can Ι offer Him,
Than wholly to give up my heart to God, joining it closely
· unto His.

Then all my inward sels shall leap for joy,
When my soul shall wholly be at one with God.
Then shall He say to me,

“Wilt thou be with Me?
1 will be with thee.”

And 1 shall answer,
‘⁸ O Lord‚ bow down and stay with me,

And l shall love to be with Thee5
This is the end of my desire,
A heart made one with Thee.''
