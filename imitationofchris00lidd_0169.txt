And drunken with salvation's cup,*
WVherein are all the joys of paradise;

And (though with happier, sweeter taste)
The holy angels share the banquet with us.

June ¹⁷· How great, how high the office of the priest,
To whom 'tis given to consecrate the Lord of majesty with
holy words,
With lips to bless Him,
In the hand to hold Him,
With his own mouth to take,
And to the rest to minister.

How clean should be those hands,
How pure that mouth,
How sanctified the body,
How spotless shall the priest's heart be,
To whom the Author of all purity so often comes.
From the priest's mouth no word should go,
But what is holy, useful, honourable,—
So often does he take the sacrament of Christ.
His eyes should single be, and modest,
That ever look upon Christ's body.
Hands should be pure and raised on high,
That are ever handling Him Who made the heaven and
earth.
To priests above all others, it is written in the Law,
‘⁴ Be ye holy,
For I, the Lord your God, am holy too.”

O God Almighty, let Thy touch assist us,
- Us who have taken on ourselves the priestly office3

* Et calice inebrians salutari.
