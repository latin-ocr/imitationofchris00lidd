THE LOVE OF GOD. 171

Free me from evil passions,

Make my heart clean from all ill-ordered loves,
That I be in health within and throughly purged,
Fit to be a lover,

Brave to be a sufferer,

Firm to go onwards to the end.

Love is a great thing,
A blessing very good,
The only thing that makes all burdens light,
Bearing evenly what is uneven‚
Carrying a weight, not feeling it,
Turning all bitterness to a sweet savour.
The noble love of Jesus drives men on to do great deeds‚
And always rouses thern to long for what is better.
Love would be lifted up,
Not held by any thing of earth.
It would be free,
A stranger to the affection of the world,
That its view within may not be blurred,
For sear it get into the nets of temporal happiness,
Or sor some unhappiness lie down and die.

Nothing 1s sweeter, stronger, broader, higher,

Fuller, better, or more pleasant in the heaven or earth.
It is the child of God,

Nor can it rest except in Him

Above the world created.

The lover runs and fiies and is alive with joy,
Free, unrestrained,

Gives all for all,

Has all in all,

In one alone he rests, all else neglected‚
