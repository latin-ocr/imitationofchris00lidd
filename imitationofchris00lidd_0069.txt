HEART-SORROW. 43

Happy the man who can cast off the burden of
distracting cares,
And gather up the fragments of his thoughts to one-
A holy sorrow for his sin.
Happy the man who drives away from him
All that can weigh upon or stain his better sels.

11.

Fight like a man,
Good habits overcome the bad.

If you could let men go their way,
They will let you go yours.
Then drag not others’ matters on yourself,
And do not wrap yourself in greater men’s affairs,
But always keep your eye first on yoztrseff,
And give your warnings to yourself, not to all those
you love.

You may not have fair words from men ; be not-so sad

for that,

But that you do not live a life careful or good enough,

As fits God‘s servant and a pious soul,

This should be a grief to you indeed.

often men find it better, safer far,

Not to have many comforts in this life,

And least of all the comforts of the flesh ;

But that we have not comforts from on high,

Or if we only feel them now and then,

We are to blame;

We do not seek beart-sorrow,

Nor do we cast aside the empty consolation of the outer
world.

Know that you deserve no comfort from on high,
But rather tribulation ;
