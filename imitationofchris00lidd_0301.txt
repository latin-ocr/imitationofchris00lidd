IN THE HANDS OF GOD. 269

Let Thy servant find his joy in Thee,

Not in himself, nor in another;

For Thou alone art my true joy,

My hope, my crown,

My delight‚ my honour, O my Lord.
What has Thy servant,

Save what he has from Thee, unmerited ¹?
Thine is all that Thou hast given,

And all that Thou hast done.

From my youth up I am poor and in the midst of toils;

My soul is sometimes sorrowful to tears,

And sometimes greatly out of quiet because of passions
hanging over it.

Ι long for joyful peace,

I want the peace of all Thy sons,

Fed by Thee in the light os consolation.

If Thou givest peace,

If Thou pourest on me holy joy,

Thy servant’s soul shall be filled full of music,

And shall be pious in Thy praise.

But if Thou takest away Thy peace, as oft Thou dost,

His soul will not be able to run the way of Thy command-
ments.

His knees are bent : he smites his breast,

Because it is not for his soul to-day as it was yesterday
or heretofore, when Thy lantern shone about his
head,

And 'neath Thine overshadowing wings he was protected.

Nov 26· Father‚ just and always to be praised,

The hour is corne: Thy servant must be tried.
O Father lovable,
