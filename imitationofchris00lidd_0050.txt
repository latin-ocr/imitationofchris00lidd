24 MEETING TEMPTATIONS.

‘¹ Withstand disease’s onslaught at the gate,

The leech’s aster-thought may be too late.''

For first upon the mind the simple thought beats in,

Then comes the stronger picture of the Sin,

Then comes delight in it, and then

We basely meet it and we yield.

And thus by slow degrees the wicked foe gets in with all
his power,

If at the first he finds no enemy;

And he who lazily puts off the fight becomes

Weaker and weaker every day ;

Stronger and stronger is his foe.

VI.
Some meet their heaviest trials at the first
Along the pathway of their road to God.
Some at the ending of the way.
Some too are visited, it seems, through all their lives,
Some lightly tried enough,
As God in wisdom and in justice wills,
Who weighs what each man is, what each deserves,
And from of old ordains all things that work the safety of
His own.

Therefore we ought not to despair when tried,
But raise a brighter flame of prayer continually to God,
That He will deign to help us in all our harrowing cares,
For, in the words of Paul, He “will provide
Along with trial, an escape

To make it possible for us to bear it.

Humble your souls then 'neath the hand οξ God
In every trial and in every woe.
The lowly-minded He will raise—will save.
In trials and in cares the progress of the man is shown3
