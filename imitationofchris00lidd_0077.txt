MUSJNG ON DEA TH. 51

Better provide in time,

And send some good deed on your road before you,
Than put your hope in others’ help.

And if you are not careful for yourself to-day,

Who will be anxious sor you in the time to come?

Now is the hour so precious ;
Now are the days of safety for your soul3
Now is the time acceptable.
How sad it is you do not spend it better
When you may gain your meed—eternal life.

There will come a moment
When you will long for one poor day, or for a single hour,
Wherein you may improve ;
And then perhaps you will not get your boon.
Come then, my darling one;
Freed from how great a peril you may be,
Snatched from how great a sear,
If only you have always been afraid that death is coming,
watching his step.

Try then so on earth to live

. That in the hour of death you may be glad, not frightened.

Affar.8.

Learn your lesson n0w; die to the world,
That you may then begin to live with Christ.
Learn your lesson now; scorn all,

That you may then be free to go to Him.
Chasten your body now by penance,

That then your confidence may be more sure.

111.

Ah, fool, why think you you will live so long ἲ
For you have no day sure to you.
How many are deceived,
