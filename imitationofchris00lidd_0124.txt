94 ROYAL PATHWAY OF THE HOLY CROSS.

Why then sear to take it up ?
By it you win your way into the kingdom.

April 26· In the Cross is safety,
In the Cross is life,
In the Cross protection from our foes,
In the Cross is sweetness
Poured on us from above;
In the Cross is spiritual joy,
In the Cross the sum of virtues ς
In the Cross is holiness in perfect beauty.
There is no safety to the soul,
No hope of life eternal,
Save in the Cross.
Take then your Cross and follow Jesus,
And your path shall lead to everlasting life.
He went His way before you,
Carrying the burden for Himself.
He died for you upon it,
That you might take your own
And die upon it too,
But if you die with Him,
Even so with Him you live;
And if you are the comrade of His pain,
You shall share His glory t00.

April27. See—in the Cross all lies,
In death upon it all consists;
And there is none other road
That leads to life and to true peace of sou13
None other save the holy Cross,
The daily killing of our sins.
Walk where you will,
Seek what you will,

And you will never find a higher road above,
