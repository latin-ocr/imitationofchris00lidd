220 SELF-LOVE.

1f ‘twere not so, the ssesh would rise in pride against the
spirit.
Between the need and the delight

Let Thy hand guard and teach me—
Nothing too much.

CHAPTER XXVII.

Self-love especially keeps People back from what
z's Best.

God.

Y son,
You must give all for all,

And not belong to self.
Your sels-love harms you more, you know,
Thau any other thing.
All more or less cleaves to you,
According to the love you feel for it.
VVere your love pure and simple and well-ordered,
You would not be the slave of circumstance.

Lust not
For what you may not have 3
Have not
What can impede your steps and rob you of your inner
liberty.

’Tis a strange thing, you will not give yourself to Me,
From the very bottom of your heart,
With all that you can wish and have.
Why so torn with empty sorrow Ῥ
Why so tired with useless cares ἰ)
Stand by My good pleasure—
You shall feel no loss.
