Jugy 11.

164 THE WORDS OF GOD.

Therefore‚ let no Moses speak to me,
But Thou, O Lord my God, Eternal Truth‚
For fear I die and be found fruitless,
Warned from without, not fired within3
For fear the word rise up to judge me;

The word I l1eard‚—but did not do ;
The word I kneW,———but did not love ;

The word Ι trusted,—-but did not preserve.

Speak Thou to me, O Lord; Thy servant heareth.

Thou hast the words of life eternal.

Speak Thou to me, in some way comforting my soul,
improving all my life,

To praise and glorify and ever honour Thee.

CHAPTER III.

T lze Words of God are to be heard wz'tlz Lowlz'ness;
many wezglz tlzem not at alh*

God.

EAR, My son, My words of sweetness,
Surpassing all philosophies‚
And all the knowledge of the world.
My words are truth and life,
And are not to be Weighed and judged by human sense.
They should be received in silence,
Taken with all humility and love.

And 1 said, The Soul-

Blest is the man Thou trainest, Lord,
Teaching him from Thy law,

To make the evil days seem sweet to him,
That he may not be desolate on earth.

'¹‘ In this and other Chapters the familiar “you'' is subsiituted
for ‘⁴ thou⁷¹ when God is speaking to the fatihful soul.
