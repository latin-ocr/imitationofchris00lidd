CHAPTER XXXIII.

The Waverz'ng of the Heart: tlte Fmal Motz've
leading up to God.

Oct. 14 Y son, trust not your present wishes;
They will soon change.
You will be the slave of life-long fickleness,
Though you wish it not.
Now glad, now sad ;
Now restful, now disturbed;
Now pious‚ now unthoughtful;
Now given to work, now full of sloth;

Now grave, now light.

But high above these things that change is the wise man

with spirit well taught,

Who cares not what he feels,

Nor from what quarter blows the shifting breeze‚

Is but the holy motive of his mind go onward to the due
and longed-for end.

For thus will he be able to remain the same, unshaken,

Pointing the simple eye of motive

Through many changing chances straight at Me.

The purer that this eye of motive is,
The straighter sails the vessel through the many stormS.

But it is dim in many men,
For men soon look aside at anything delightsome,
And rarely is one found quite free from the sels-secking

stain.
So in old days the Jews had come to Bethlehem.-
