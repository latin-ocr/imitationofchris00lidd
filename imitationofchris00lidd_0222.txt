190 OBEDIENCE UNTO OTHERS.

The more you take yourself away from all the comfort ot
the world, '

The sweeter and the greater consolation shall you find
in Me.

But at the first you will not gain all this
’Without some sorrow and without some toil.
The rooted habit will stand up against you,
To be conquered only by the better one.
The flesh will mutter ever and again,

To be bridled only by the spirit‘s zeal.

The serpent, the old foe, will sting you and embitter you,
To be put to ssight by prayer.

And one of his wide entrances

May be blocked up by useful work.

CHAPTER XIII.

A Hmnhle Soul's Obedience mtto OtherS, after the
Paltern set by Jesus Christ.

God.

Y son,
The man who strives to slip from his obedience
Slips too from grace;
And he who looks lor private blessings

Loses the blessings that belong to all.

He who does not submit himself to his superior willingly
and freely,
It is a sign he is not master of his flesh.
It often kicks against the goad and mutters.
Learn then this lesson soon 3
Bow down to him who is above you,
lf you would bring your ssesh under the yoke3
