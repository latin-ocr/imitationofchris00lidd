VALUING OURSELVES AT NOTHING. 181

What Ι arn and have been,

And the path by which Ι came;

For Ι am nothing, and Ι knew it not.

IfI am left to mine own self,

See, there is nothing there ; all wickedness.
But if Thou suddenly dost gaze on me,

At once Ι am made strong,

And filled with 3 fresh joy ;

And it is very wonderful

If Ι so quickly am raised up,

So kindly taken to Thine arms,

Ι who of my own weight am always sinking to the depths.

Thy love does this, freely preventing me,
Helping when I so often am in need,
Guarding me also from great perils,
Snatching me from unnumbered ills.
Since by the wicked love of self Ι lost myself,
And found both Thee and me by only seeking Thee aud
purely loving Thee,
For very love bringing myself to nothing.
For Thou, O sweetest friend, dost with me
More than all that Ι deserve, dare hope or ask.

11.

Aug. 4· Blessed be Thou, my God,
Because, though Ι be yet unworthy of all good,
Thine infinite goodness and nobility never cease their
kindness unto those that are ungrateful and are
turned away from Thee.

Turn us to Thee,
To make us thankfnl, humble‚ and devout
Thou art our safety,
Our might, our strength.
