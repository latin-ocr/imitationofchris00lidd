180 VALUING OURSELVES AT NOTHING.

A man's merits are not to be weighed by this, that, may

be, he sees full many a vision, hears many a
consoling voice,

That he is skilled in Holy Scripture,

That he is set in lofty seats;

But to be placed upon the rock of true humility‚

Filled with the charity of God,

Seeking His honour with a pure and single eye,

Deeming himself as nothing, really contemptuous of self,

And readier far to be looked down on by the world, to be
humbled and despised‚ not honoured.

CHAPTER VIII.

Valuing Ourselves at Nothing before the E yes
of God.

WILL speak unto my Lord,
Who am but dust and ashes,

If I think any better of myself,
Thou standest over against me ;
My wickedness gives testimony true,
Nor have Ι anything to say.
But if Ι make myself as vile,
And bring myself to nothing,
Give up all thoughts of self,
Bruise myself to dust (I am but dust),
Thy grace shall be kind to me;
Thy light come near my heart;
And sels-esteem, never so little though it be,
Shall be sunk low into the valley of my nothingness and
die for ever.
Then Thou showest me to myself
