166 A PRA YER.

Far happier in the race for vanity,
Than you for truth.

Yet they are often cheated of their hopes.
My promises cheat none,
And send away none empty that puts his trust in Me.
All Ι have promised Ι will give;
All I have said Ι will fulfil,
If one will but continue faithful to the end in loving Me.
I give rewards to all the good,
Ι set my seal of favour on the pious soul*

July 14· W rite in your heart My words; weigh them with care ;
For in temptation’s hour they shall be very needful to you.
What you grasp not when you read,

You shall see clear when I come down to you.
My visits to my chosen ones are two—-

Of trial, and of comfort.

Ι read two Iessons to them every day:

One, when Ι lash their sins ;

One, when I cheer them on to better things.
The man that has My words and scorns them,
Makes for himself a judge at the last day.

A Prayer to askfor Holy leozcghtS.

july 15· Lord God, my all Thou art,
And who am Ι to dare to speak to Thee ‘e
Ι arn the poorest little slave of Thine,

The lowest little worm,—
Poorer far, far more contemptible,
Than Ι know or dare to say.

Yet think on me, Ο Lord,
For Ι am nothing,

* Fortis probator omniurn devotorum.
