WISH TO BETTER ALL OUR LIVES. 57

Judgment nor hell,

Because his perfect love gives him safe access to his
God.

But he who still clings to his sin,

What wonder if he fears his death and shuns the sentence ’ἓ

Yet it is good

That if your love for God cannot recall you from your evil
ways,

Fear of gehenna should compel you.

But he who puts the sear of God behind his back

Cannot stand long in good;

Too quickly will he run into the devil's nets.

CHAPTER XXV.
A Burnz'ng Wz’sh to Better All Our Lives,

E watchful in God’s service and be diligent,
And osten muse on what the life is you have chosen,

And why you left the world.
Was it not to live to God,
And to be a spiritual man ’.Ρ
Strive to make progress on your way;
For soon you will receive the wages of your toil,
And sear and sorrow shall no more be in your borders.
You shall do a little work,
And you shall find great rest, eternal joy.
If you continue in your work, zealous and true,
God will be surely true to you, and rich in His rewards.
Keep a fair hope
That you will one day win the palm ;
But nurse no careless spirit,
Lest you get sluggish, or else proud,
