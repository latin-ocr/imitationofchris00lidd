THE LESSON OF PATIENCE. 189

But how long, think you, will they last?

See how they that are abundant in the world sade like a
smoke ;

Record of their past glories there is none.

Nay, even while they yet are in this lise

They get no quiet from their joys: they spend their days
in bitterness, in wearincss and fcar ;

For that same thing from which they get delight

Brings on them sorrow often for its punishment,

And justly so ;

That as they seek and follow after their dclights unchecked,

They should fill full the pleasant cup in bitterness of
heart and in confusion.

Short, how short,

How lying,

How base and how unbridled all these pleasures are.

For very drunkenness and blindness men perceive it not,

But, like durnb animals,

For trissing sweetness in a life that fades they dare the
murder of a soul.

11.

Therefore‚ My son, follow not your lusts,
Turn from your own will back again,
Delight you in the Lord,
And He shall give you what your heart desircs.
Where lies your blessing ¹?
Whence shall abundant comfort come to you ⁴?
In scorning all the world,
In cutting out* all low delights that fester in you,
If you would be truly pleased and fully comforted by Me.

* Abscissione.
