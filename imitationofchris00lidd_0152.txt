1 22 THE PRIESTHOOD.

For this is not a debt due to the worth of man,

That man should consecrate or touch Christ’s sacrament,
And take for food the angels’ bread.
Great is the service,

Great the dignity, of priests,
To whom is given what is not trusted to the angels.

For only priests, who duly in the Church have been ordained‚
Have power to celebrate and consecrate the body of Christ.

A priest indeed is minister to God,
Using the word of God, God bidding and appointing him ;
But God is there—chief Author, Worker invisible ς
All that He wills bows down to Him,
All that He bids obeys Him.
Then in this sacrament most excellent you should trust
more to God omnipotent

Than to your senses or to signs that you can see.
And with fear and reverence

Come to a work like this.

11.

Turn to yourself,

And see whose service has been given to you when the
bishop laid his hands on you.

See: you were made a priest,
And consecrated one to celebrate.
Take heed then that you faithfully and piously offer the
sacrifice to God at fitting times,
And show yourself a blameless man.
You have not made your burden lighter,
But you have bound yourself by closer bonds of discipli11e,*

* Sed artiori jam alligatus es vinculo disciplinae:
Et ad majorem teneris perfectionem sanctitatis,
