ΝΟ CONSOLATION. 87

And in the hope of favour from on high.

For though good mcn be near me, pious brothers, faithful
friends,

Sweet songs or hymns,

All these please me but a little,

Taste but a little,

WVhen 1 am left by God and find mysclf in my own
poverty.

Then there is no better remedy

Than patience and sels-sacrifice beneath the will of God.

Never did I meet with man so pious, so devout,

Who, now and then, had not some lessening of God's
kindness,

Who did not feel God’s favour, now and then, grow smaller.

None so holy, so high wrought, so full of light,

Who has not been tempted‚ in days gone by, or now.

For he deserves not to enjoy a lofty thought of God,

Who is not tried for God by sorrow.

Trial is wont to be the sign of comfort coming soon ;

For to men proved by trial

Heavenly consolation is vouchsafed,—

“To him that overcometh Ι will give for food the tree of
life ; '’

And consolation from on high is sent

To make us brave to bear adversity.

Temptation follows

That man may not be proud for blessings he has had.

The devil does not sleep,

And ssesh is not yet dead.

Haste therefore to prepare you for the fray;

For on your right hand and your left

Stand foes who never rest.
