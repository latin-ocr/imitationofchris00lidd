22 MEETING TEMPTATIONS.

To meet temptations that he knows are his,

For sear the devil, never slumbering,

But going up and down in questos men he may devour,
Find a weak place to cheat him in.

None so holy, none so good,

As not to meet temptation now and them

We cannot quite be free.

11.

Yet there are trials (hard and troublesome, may be)
Very useful unto men ;
For, meeting them,
We are brought low, made pure, made wise.

All saints have gone through many a trouble,—many
a harrowing care
Gone through with gain ;
And those that could not bear them—-
They have deserted God, and failedfi‘·

111.
No order is so holy, and no spot so hidden‚
That troubles and temptations may not come.
Long as he lives, man is not safe from them,
Because the root whence the temptation comes lies in
himself.

For we were born in lust.

One trial or one sorrow ebbs away; another takes its place ;
And we shall always find something to bear,

Since man has lost the blessing of his happy state.†

IV.

Many try to shun their trials ;
Deeper is their fall.

* Reprobi facti sunt. † That is, in Paradise.
