UNION WJTH CHRIST. 143

CHAPTER XIII.

The Pious Soul slzould in the Sacrament long with
all its Heart to be at One witlz Christ.

The Voice of the Leamer.

June 2¹· I WOULD that one would grant me,
O my Lord,

To find Thee only, and to open all my heart to Thee,
And take Thee as my soul would long to do ;

That none would gaze at me,

That no created thing would glauce at me or trouble me,

That Thou alone wouldst speak to me and 1 to Thee,
As a lover talking to his loved one,

A friend at table with his friend.
This is my prayer, my longing,
To be made one with Thee,
My heart withdrawn from all things that are made,

Learning to taste eternity and heaven by frequent celebra-
tion and communion.
Ah, my Lord God,

When shall I be quite one with Thee, drawn in to Thee,
Myself utterly forgotten,
Thou in me, Ι in Thee ’ἓ

Grant us to stay thus—one.

Thou truly art my loved One, chosen from thousands,

In Whom my soul hath been well-pleased to dwell for all
the days of life.

Thou truly art my peace-maker,
In Whom my greatest peace, my true rest lies,

Apart from VVhom it is but toil and endless woe-
Thou truly art the hidden God,

“ Thy counsel is not with the wicked,
Thy talk is with the simple and the humble.
