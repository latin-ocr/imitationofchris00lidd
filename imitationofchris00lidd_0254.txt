222 AGAJNST THE TONGUES OF SLANDERERS.

But let me look at all as passing shows,
Myself to pass as well.

For nothing stays under the sun,

Where all is vanity and trouble of spirit.
O wise is he who sees life thus.

Grant me, Lord, the heavenly wisdom, that 1 may leam

to seek and find Thee above all, to taste and love
Thee before all,

Understanding all things as they are according to the
ordering of Thy wisdom.

Grant me to turn away from him that ssatters me,

Quietly to bear with him that crosses me.

For this is the great wisdom—

Not to be moved with every windy word,

Not to give an ear unto the siren wickedly enticing us;

Then our early steps will lead to peace.*

CHAPTER XXVIII.
Agaz'nst the T ongues of SlandererS.

God.

Y ssellZe it not ill that some think badly of you,

And say what you dislike to hear ;
You should believe worse stories of yourself,

And fancy none weaker than you.

If you walk within,

You will think little of flying words.
’Tis no small prudence to be silent in the evil time, and

inwardly to turn to Me,
And not to be disturbed by what men think.

* Sic enirn incepta pergitur via secure.
