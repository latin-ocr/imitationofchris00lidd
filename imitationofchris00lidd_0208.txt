176 THE PROOF OF A TRUE LOVER.

Humble confession angers him,
And. if he could,

He would stop you from communion.

Trust not his words, and takeno heed of him,
Often though he throw temptation's nets around you.
When he puts evil counsels and impure within you,
Say to him,

“ Go, foul spirit;
Blush, thou wretch.
Very impure thou art,
That bringest thoughts like this into my ears.
Depart from me, thou vile sedueer,
No lot hast thou in me ;
But Jesus shall be with me like a warrior brave,
And thou shalt stand confounded.
Far rather had Ι die and meet with any punishment
Than listen unto thee.
Hold thy peace; be dumb;
I will not hear thee more,
Though thou bring more trouble still upon me.
God is my light and my salvation ;
Whom shall 1 sear ’.Ρ
If wars rise up against me,
My heart shall not be afraid.
God is my helper
And my redeemer.''

Fight like a soldier true,
And if from frailty you sometimes fall,
Trusting in My fuller power,
Put on a might sar greater than before ;
And yet beware, beware of vain complacency and pride.
Thus it is that many are led wrong,
