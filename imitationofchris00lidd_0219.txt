LIMI T S. 187

But if there lurk some touch of secking after self,

This is the thing that hinders you and weighs you down.

Take heed then not to strive too much

Over a thought of your own heart,

Conceived without consulting Me,

For sear you afterwards be sorry and displeased

At what first pleased you, at what you showed such zeal
for as the better way.

For every feeling that seems good

Must not be followed up at once ;

And if it seems not good

It is not to be shunned at first.

n.

Even in our longings for the good sometimes the rein

is needed,

For fear by eagerness of mind we run into a careless way,

And by our want of discipline bring scandal upon others,

Or even when others cross us we on a sudden be disturbed
and fall.

But now and then you must use violence,

And manfully oppose the lusts of sense,

Caring not what the ssesh desires or hates,

But dwelling more on this,

That it be made a subject of the spirit, willingly or no.

And it must needs be punished,

Compelled to be obedient,

Till it be ready to do all and leam to be content with
little,

And to delight in what is simple,

And not to mutter against what suits it not.
