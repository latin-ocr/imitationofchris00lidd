LJFE ETERNAL. 265

Enlarge your heart and take this holy inspiration with
your whole desire.

Give great thanks unto the goodness from on high,

Which deals with you so condescendingly,

Visits you kindly‚ rouses you zealously, raises you mightily,

That by your weight you slip not back again to earth.

Not by your own thought or endeavour do you get it,

But merely by the condescension of the heavenly kindness
and by God's looking on you,

That you may profit in the virtues and in greater lowliness,

And make you ready for the coming fight,

And try to cleave to Me with all your heart's affection,

And serve Me with a burning will.

11.

My son,
The fire is osten bright,
Yet without smoke the ssame does not ascend;
So some men's longings burn unto celestial things,
And yet they are not free from the temptations of the ssesh.
In asking' things so zealously of God,
They do not always act with a pure motive for God’s honour.

And this is often what the longing means,

Which you said would be so anxious.

That is not pure, that is not perfect,

Which has been stained with thoughts of your own profit.

Seek not what pleases you or profits you,

But what will be received by Me and honours Me ;

For, think but rightly of it,

You ought to put My rule before your wishes, and before
all you long for, and to follow it.

1 know what you desire,
And 1 have heard your frequent groans.
