NA TURE’S CORRUPTION. 283

CHAPTER LV.

Natccre's Corruptz'on : the Power of tlze Influence
Divina*

ORD GOD, Thou didst create me in Thine image and

Thy likeness‚

Grant me this inssuence from Thee which Thou hast shown
to be so great, so needful for salvation,

That I may conquer my most wicked nature, which drags
me down to ruin and to sin.

For in my ssesh I feel the law of sin,

Warring against the mental law, and often leading me a
captive to my sensual being.

I cannot stand against its passions,

If Thy most holy influence assist me not, poured like a
ssame upon my heart.

1 need Thy favouring iussuence,† I need it much,

lf nature is to be defeated,—

Nature, ever prone to evil from its youth :

For through Adam, the first man, it fell and was through
sin befouled,

And to all men comes down the penalty for this first
stain.

And nature's sels, once sair and right as formed by Thee,

'¹‘ Gratia. Ῑ shrink from using the word “grace '' more than
Ι can help 5 because it conveys little or no real meaning to people.
Inssuence, favour, kindness, thanks, a touch from God, beauty,
righteousneSS, power—these are a few of the meanings of the “
word. The writer uses it in very many senseS, and conse-
quentlyl make bold to translate it in many ways; but 1 have

generally put the Latin words at the foot of the page.
† Gratia.
