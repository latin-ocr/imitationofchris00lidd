294 THE SECRETS OF GOD.

I know what each dese-mes,

Ι went before them in the blessings of My sweetness,

I knew before the ages who My lovcd ones were;

Ι chose them from the world,

They chose not Me.

1 called them by My favour,

I drew them by My pity‚

I led them on through many a temptation,

Ι poured upon them wondrous consolations,

Ι gave them strength unto the end,

I crowned their suffering,

I know thern first and last,

Ι throw My arms, with love past telling, round them.

Ι must be praised in all My saints,

Ι must be blessed past all, honoured ineach of them,

VVhom Imade so gloriously great, whom Ipredestined3
they had no merit of their own.

He then who scorns one of My little ones,

Pays no honour to the great,

For Ι made weak and great;

And he who robs one saint of anything,

Robs Me of it, and all the rest in heaven.

All are one by the bond of charity.

They feel the same, they think the same;

They love each other as one,

And, what is higher far,

They love Me more than sels or any merit of their own.

For they are rapt out of themselves, and drawn away from
their own love,

Hastening all to Mine,

In which they rest with joy.

Nothing can turn their looks away, nothing depress them;

For they are full of everlasting truth,

And glow with fire of charity not to be quenched.
