SHUNNING EXCESS IN TALK. 17

But to refuse to listen to another,
When reason or the case demands it,
Is the mark of wilfulness and pride.

CHAPTER X.
Shunm'ng Excess in Talk.

lan. ¹9- AS far as may be, shun the noisy throngs of men,
For talk about the doings of the present world hinders
you much,

Simple though the motive be.

For we are spotted soon by vanity, and soon enslaved.
O that I had oi'tener heiu my peace
And been away from men.

11.

But why are we so glad to talk and take our turns to
prattle,

When so rarely we get back to the stronghold of our
sssence

With an unwounded conscience ’.Ρ

We are so glad to talk

Because we look for comfort each from one another's words,

Because we long to ease the heart weighed down by many
a fancy,

And we are very prone to speak of what we love andlong for,

Or of all the things we think are going against us.

But, sad to say,

Our talk is often empty, often vain.

This comfort from without

Is no small enemy to that from God which speaks to us
within.
