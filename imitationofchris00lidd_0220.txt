against thsts.

The Soul.

Aug. ¹5· LORD GOD, I see that patience is indeed needed by me,

For much in this my life goes contrary;
For whatsoever plan I lay down for my peace,
My life cannot be spent away srom war and pain.

God.

It is even so, My son;
But Ι ” would have you never seek a peace that lacks
temptation and never meets a cross,
I would have you think
That peace is only found
When you are tried by many a care,
And proved in face of many an opposition.

If you will say you cannot suffer much,
How will you bear the flames of purgatory Ῥ
Choose the lesser evil always,

And try to bear the evils of to—day
With even-mindedness for God,
To escape the doom that shall not end.

1 · Think you that worldly men suffer but little ἰ’

Ask the question of the softest lives ;
You will not find it so.

But, Say you, they have many a dclight,
They follow aster their own wills,

And care but little for their tribulations.
Let it be so,

They have their pleasures3
