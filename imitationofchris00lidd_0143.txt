GOD‘S GOODNESS AND CHARITY. 113

And yet Ι long devoutly to receive Him.

What better, what more healthful thought to me,

Than wholly before Thee to humble self,

And raise high over me Thine unending goodness Ῥ

Ι praise Thee, O my God, and lift Thee up for ever.

1 scorn myself and lay me low down in the depths of all
my sm.

Holy of Holies, Th0u;
And I, the scum of sinners.
Thou bendest down to me;
I am not fit to look at Thee again.
Lo, Thou wouldst come to me,
Thou wouldst be with me,
Thou callest me to this Thy feast,
Thou wouldst give me heavenly food,
And angels' bread to eat,
No other than the living bread, that down from heaven

descended, Thee Thyself,

That givest the world life.

1 · See whence love comes,

What condescension shines from Thee.

How great the thanks and praise owed Thee for this.
How healthful and how useful was Thy plan,
When Thou didst institute this rite.

How sweet and pleasant is the feast,

When Thou didst give Thyself for food.
How wonderful Thy working, O my God,
How strong Thy power,

Thy truth beyond all speech;

For Thou didst speak and all was made,
And this was done that Thou didst bid.
Wouderful, worthy of belief,

And yet outstripping human understanding,
