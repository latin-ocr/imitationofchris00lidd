244 No GOOD [Ν SELF.

But when he comes to it,

He slowly changes what he felt;
For his affections do not always circle round the same,
But drive him on from one unto another.

No trisse is it then even in trisses to abandon sels.

Man's real progress
Is in sels—denial.
A sels-denying man
Is very free and safe,
But the old enemy, opposing all the good we do, is never
slow to tempt us,
And day and night sets his strong snares
To try and make the careless stagger into his deceptive net.
‘⁴ Watch ye and pray‚'' th us saith the Lord,
⁴⁴ That ye enter not into temptation.”

CHAPTER XL.

Man has no Good of Himself, and can Boast os
None.

. ‘⁴ ORD, what is man, that Thou art mindful of him ¹?

Or the son of man, that Thou dost visit him ’.Ρ ”
What has man merited,
That Thou shouldst give Thy grace to him ’Β
And how can Ι complain if Thou desert me ‘?
Or what can Ι put forward if Thou dost not what I ask?
Lord, Ι am nothing,
I can do nothing,
Have nothing good of my own sels.
In all I fail;

1 ever tend to naught.
