AGAJNST MEN’S VAIN OPINIONS. 239

He could not have prevented.

Therefore he trusted all to God, God that knew all,

And in quiet and humility maintained his cause, against
the unfair lips,

The empty lying thoughts, the words they hurled upon
him as they pleased.

Yet he did answer now and then,

That the weak should not be offended if he held his peace.

11.

And who are you,
That you should fear a mortal man ἰ)
To-day he is,
To-morrow he is not seen.
Fear God ;
You will not shudder at the terrors man can show.
What cau man do to you by words or injuries ’.Ρ
He hurts himself, not you;
Nor can he, be he who he may, escape God’s judgment.
Keep God before your eyes ;
Fight not against man's querulous words,
And if just now you seem to be brought low,
And to be suffering a confusion that you did not merit,
Be not angry ;
Take not a ssower from your wreath by your impatience ;'
But rather look to Me in heaven,
For I can snatch you out of every wrong and trouble,
And give to every man according to his deeds.

* Neque per impatientiam minuas coronam tuam.
