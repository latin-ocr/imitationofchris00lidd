298 GOD ONL Y.

Thou art my longing,

And therefore Ι must moan for Thee, and cry, and pray.
In no one can Ι fully trust

To help me in my needs when most I want it,

Save in Thee, my God, alone.

Thou art my hope, my trust,

My comforter, my faithful friend in all.

All seek their own,
Thou only aimest at my safety and my good,
And turnest all to blessing for me.
Though Thou expose me unto many a cross and trial,
This Thou ordainest to my use,
And in a thousand ways art wont to prove Thy loved ones;
In the which proof Thou shouldst not less be praised and
loved
Than if Thou wert to fill me with the heavenly consolation.
Therefore in Thee, Lord God, Ι put my hope and refuge,
On Thee I lay my trouble and my care,
For 1 find all weak, unsteady,
That Ι see apart from Thee,

Numbers of friends will help me not,
Brave comrades cannot aid me,
Wise counsellors can give no useful answer,
Learned books yield no comfort,
No precious substance can deliver me,
No pleasant and no secret place can save me,
If Thou aid not, comfort, console, instruct, and guard.
For all that seems to lead to peace and happiness
Is nothing without Thee,
And truly brings no jot of happiness.
Therefore Thou art the end of every good, the pinnacle of
life,
The depth of eloquence ;
