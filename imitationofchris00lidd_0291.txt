ANY TROUBLES MUST BE BORNE. 259

CHAPTER XLVII.

Any Τ roubles must be Borne for Everlasting
jaffe.

Jesus.
Nov. 16· h Y son,

Be not broken by the toilsome burdens borne for
Me,
Nor cast down wholly by the tribulations.
Be always strengthened and consoled by what I promise,
1 can repay you past all manner and measure.

You shall not toil here long,
Always weighed down with grief.
Wait awhile,

You will soon see the evil's end.

An hour will come,

And all the work and noise shall stop.
What passes by with time

Is small and brief.

Do your deed,
Work faithfully among the vines,
Ι will be your wages.
Write, read, and sing,
Gman, pray, keep silence,

Bear crosses bravely‚—-
Eternal life is worth all this and greater battles,

In one day peace shall come; God knows how soon.
Then neither day nor night shall be,
But light eternal and unending beauty,

Firm peace, sure rest.
You shall not then say, ‘⁸ who shall sree me from the body

of this death ’Β ”
