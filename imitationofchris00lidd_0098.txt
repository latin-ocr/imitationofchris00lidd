70 THE HIGHER LIFE WITHIN.

Had you once tasted of His glowing love,
You would care little for your private weal or woe,
Nay,—you would be glad when insults corne,

Because the love of Him makes men heap scorn upon
themselves.

Mar. 25- He who loves Jesus and loves truth,
The man of really inner life,
From unchecked passions free,
Can turn himself with ease to God,
And lift himself above himself in thought,
And rest in peace, enjoying Him.

The man who tastes life as it really is,
Not as men talk of it,
Not as men value it,
He is the true philosopher,
Taught of God, and not of men.
The man who learns to walk the inward road,
Weighing outward life as little,
Asking for no set places, wanting no fixed times
To pray his holy prayers,
He soon collects his thoughts,
Because he never dissipates his life
Upon the outward world.
No outside work stands in his way,
No business “that cannot wait '';
But as things come
He fits himself to them.
The man of inward method, ordered well,
Cares nothing for the strange and zig-zag ways of men.
The more we draw the world to us,
The more we listen, and the rougher is the road.

If it were well with you, if you were truly purged,
