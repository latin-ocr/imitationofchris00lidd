VAIN KNOWLEDGE. 249

1f you would wholly bring yourself to nothing,

And sree yourself srom all created love,

Then would I drop the dews of great grace on you.
NVhen you glance back upon the creature,

You lose the sight of the Creator.

Learn in all things to overcome yourself for the Creator's
sake,

And then you will soon reach unto the knowledge of your
God.

If you will love and look upon a thing excessively, small
though it be,

It keeps you back from what is high : it spoils you.

CHAPTER XLIII.
Agaz'nst Vaz‘n and Worldly Knowledge.

God.
ON,

Let not men’s fair and subtle speech disturb you.
God's kingdom is not talk,
But power.
Hark to My words; for they set hearts on fire and flood
the mind with light.
They make men very sorry ; on all sides they bring balm.

Never read a word
To seem more wise and learned.
Try to make your vices dead,
This will avail you more than if you knew many hard
questions,
Read much, learn much,
Yet you must always come to one beginning—-
l am He

That teaches man knowledge.
