LOVE OF SOLITUDE AND SILENCE. 37

Laying our plans from one feast to another,

As though we were upon that day to take our ssight out of
this passing world

To an eternal holy—day.

Therefore we ought with care at pious times to make our-
selves the readier,

Live holier lives,

Keep closer watch on every deed,

As though we soon from God’s hands should receive

The meed for all our toil.

And, if that day be long,

We must believe we are not ready yet,

We are not worthy yet to feel “the greatness of the glory

That will shine out in our own selves at the appointed time
when the veil is drawn away,''

And we must try to make ourselves more ready sor the
journey home.

‘⁶ Blessed the servant,'’

Says the gospel-writer Luke‚

‘⁴ VVhom his master shall find watching when he comes.

I say to you

That over all his goods he will appoint him lord.’'

If you can tear yourself away from useless talk,
