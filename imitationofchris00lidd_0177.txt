THE POWER TO PRAY. 147

Leaving to God the visitation-—its length, its fashion—
until it comes to you from Him.

When inwardly your holy thoughts are slight or none,
Humble yourself,
But do not be too much cast down,
Nor yet inordinately sad.
In one short moment God will often give
What in long lapse of time He has denied.
Sometimes He gives us at the end
What He would not grant when our prayers began.
And if His touch were always granted soon,
Were always ready as we wanted it,
'Twould not be easy for weak men to bear it.
Therefore with good hope and with humble patience
You must await the power to pray.*

June 26. Yet, when it is not given,
When it is taken from you in some hidden way,

Impute it to yourself and to your sins.

Sometimes it is a little thing that hinders it or hides it
from us;

If we may call it little (is it not rather great 3³)

That stops a boon like this.

And when you take away or fully vanquish this great or
little stumbling-block,

Then you shall have what you have sought;

For, soon as you have given yourself to God with all your

heart
Seeking neithe'r this nor that to chime in with your pleasure

and your will,
But wholly laying down yourself in Him,
You will be one with Him, and restful.
