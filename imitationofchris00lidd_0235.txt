THE CONFESSION OF OUR WEAKNESS. 203

Suffered sor God,
Can pass without some merit in God's eyes.

Theresore be ready for the battle,
If you would win the day.
Without a fight
You cannot gain the crown of patience;
And, if you will not suffer,
You rel'use the crown.
But if you want it,
Strive like a man,
And hold up patiently ;
For without toil men do not reach their rest,
And without fighting do not corne to victory.

Let every trying trouble be made lovely and desirable to
me, for Thy name sake.
For to endure and to be vexed for Thee
Is very lielpful to my soul.
