refer to Hirsche’s “Prolegomena zu einer neuen
Ausgabe der Imitatio Christi.''

If the work is in any way rescued from the mis-
understandings of many generations, my aim will

ages given its imprimatur to the volume which began
its world-wide journey from the cell in Mount St.
Agnes. From that hill-side still rings out the Mystic's

Blest is the soul that hears its Lord’s voice speaking

within it,

And takes the word of comfort srom His lips.

But to the truth that teaches from within.

Blest are the eyes
