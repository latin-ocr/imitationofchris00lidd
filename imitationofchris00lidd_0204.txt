172 THE LOVE OF GOD.

From whom all comes and flows;
Looks not to gifts,

But turns unto the givet above all.

It often knows no limit,
It boils above all measure,
Its fervour knows no stop.
It feels no weight‚
Makes light of teil,
Would do more than it can,
Pleads no impossibility,
Because it thinks it can and may do all.
So it is strong for anything‚
Is everywhere,
Gives men a title to do work,
Where he that loves not saints and fails.
In·its vigils it may sleep, but yet it dozes n0t3
Wearied, it is not worn;
Bound, it is not confined ;
Frightened‚ it is not dismayed;
But like a living flame, a burning torch,
It bursts on high, and safely goes through all.
If any loves,
He knows what these words meam*
It is a great shout in the ears of God,
That fierce heart’s love, that says,
“My Lord, my God,
Thou art all mine ; 1, Thine.''

Enlarge me in Thy love,
That my heart's lips may learn to taste how sweet it is,

To melt and swim in it.
May I be holden by it,

* Novit quid haec vox clamet3 or, He knows what this cry
means.
