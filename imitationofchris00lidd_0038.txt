12 UNBRIDLED LONGJNGS.

But let the love of simple truth draw you to read your book.
You must not ask who said it,

But what is said—attend to that.

God's truth remains for ever though men pass away,
And, without caring for the person of the writer,
God speaks to us in many ways.

111.

Often in reading Holy Writ curious thoughts obstruet
our path;
We wish to understand and argue, where we should pass by
If you would drink a profitable draught,
Read with humility,
With simpleness and faith,
And never long to gain the name of ‘⁴ wise.”
Ask your questions freely,
And hear the words of holy men—not answering them
And be not grieved by parables from older men3
Not without reason are they put before you.

CHAPTER VI.
Unbrzdled Longingsi
WHEN we desire a thing in an unbridled way,

We are at once unrestful in ourselves.
The proud and covetous are never still;
The poor and lowly-minded spend their days
In peace that never fails.

11.
The man who is not yet quite dead within himself
Is quickly tried:
In little worthless things he is defeated.
