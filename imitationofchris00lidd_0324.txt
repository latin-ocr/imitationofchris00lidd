292 THE SECRETS OF GOD.

And the first man in Paradise.

Ι am He that raises into safety them that mourn,
And those that know their weakness

1 carry forward to My heavenly state.

11.

The Soul.

Lord, blessed be Thy word,
Sweeter to my lips than honey and the honeycomb.
In woes so great and in my anguish what were Ι to do
Didst Thou not strengthen me by holy words ’.Ρ
so long as I shall come at last to the safe haven,
What care Ι how Ι suffer, or how much ’.Ρ
Give me a good end,
Give me a happy passage from the world;
Think on me, O my God,
And lead me by the straight path to Thy kingdom.
Amen.

CHAPTER LVIII.

Hz'glzer lez‘ngs of God and Secret Judgments are
not to be Searclzed Out.

God.
Dec. 22. 1 Y son,

See you dispute not of high matters and of God's
hidden judgments,—
Why he is left so desolate,
Why lze is put on such a pinnacle of favour,
Why he is so much tried,
Why [τε is lifted up so high ;
These things are quite beyond the grasp of man.
No reason, no discussion, can avail to trace the footsteps
of God's judgments.
