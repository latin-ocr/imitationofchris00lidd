HELP DI VINE. 227

1 know your thoughts in secret,
How it is good now and again for you to be without a

taste of God,

That you be not puffed up in days when all is fair,

And take some pleasure in yourself that you are what you
are not.

All that Ι gave 1 can take back,

And, when Ι will, restore it.

When Ι give it, it is Mine ς

When Ι withdraw it, Ι have not taken yours.

For every good is Mine,

And every perfect gift ;

And if I send a trouble to you, or some cross,

Be you not angry.

Keep a brave heart;

1 can raise the weight from you,

And turn all burdens into joy.

Iudeed, indeed, Ι am just,

And greatly to be praised,

When thus I deal with you.

Oct. 8. If you think rightly and look at things in truth,

You should never be so sad and so cast down about your
woes.

Rather be glad, give thanks;

Nay, think this a peculiar joy,

That Ι strike you with the blow of sorrow, and that Ι spate
you not.

As the Father loved Me,

Ι love you ;

I said it to My dear disciples,

Whom of a truth 1 sent

To great strife, not to temporal joy;

To scorn, and not to honour;
