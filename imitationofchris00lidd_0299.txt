It is a heavy burden

To carry silently.'¹’

And most of all when bidden to do what does not suit yon,
and seems useless to you.

And because, set under rule, you dare not say a word
against the higher power,

You think it hard to move at some one's nod,

And put what you feel all aside.

A quick end and a very great reward,
You will have no trouble from them,
But a great comfort for your patience.
For for this little bit of will you have now freely given,
’ You shall for ever have your will in heaven.
There shall you find all you wish,
All you can desire,
There at your hand shall be abundance of all good,
No fear of loss.
There shall your will be one with Mine,
And ask for nothing of its own apart from Me.
There no one shall resist you,
No one complain of you, ⁷
No one hinder you,
Nothing meet you in the way,
