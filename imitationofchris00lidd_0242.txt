210 THE MANV KINDNESSES OF GOD.

And with great reverence and diligent care to call to mind
Thy kindnesses, both one and all;

T hat thinking on them Ι may worthily give thanks to Thee.

But Iknow it, I confess it, that I cannot pay the debt Ι
owe for the least jot of alls*

Less am I than all the good things given me3
Ι think on Thy nobility‚

And my heart saints before its greatness.

11.

All that we have, body and soul,
Outside‚ within, from nature or from heaven,
Is but Thy bounty.
All shows Thee kind and good and pitiful,
From Whom all blessings come.

One may get more, another less;
Yet all is Thine.
Apart from Thee the smallest good cannot be held.

The owner of the greater good may not boast him of his
merit,
Nor lord it over others,
Nor exult above the lesser one3
For he is greater, lte is better
Who puts down less unto himself,
And shows his piety and humbleness in giving thanks.
The man who holds himself viler than all, unworthier than

all,
Is fitter to receive the greater blessing.

Yet he who gets the fewer gists
Must not be sad nor angry
In envy of the rich ;

* Pro minimo puncto.
