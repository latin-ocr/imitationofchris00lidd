PLANS FOR JMPROVEMENI: 125

Examine carefully your thoughts,

Cleanse thern as best you may and make them pure, in
real sorrow and in lowly shrift;

That you may have no burden there,

That you may know of no remorseful pangs,

To stop your free approach.

Frown on all your sin,

And mourn and wail especially for the transgression of
the day ; ’

And, if time suffer it,

Confess, in the secretos your heart, to God, the trouble that
your passions bring you.

Grieve and lament that up till now you are so worldly‚
such a lover of the ssesh,

Your passions so alive,

So full of restless lusts,

So careless in the watch over your outward senses,

So oft enfolded by many empty phantoms,

So much inclined to what is all around you,

So thoughtless of what lies within.

So ready for the laugh and for distraction,

So hard to turn to sorrow and to tears.

Prepared for easier rules and all that suits the flesh,

Slow to zeal or to harsh means.

Anxious to hear the news and see the beautiful,

Remiss in holding on to what is weak and lowly.

Longing to get,

Sparing to give,

Quick to hold,

Careless in talk,

Unable to rein yourself to silence,

In character undisciplined‚

In action ever ready,

Eager at food,
