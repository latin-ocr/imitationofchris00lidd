42 HEAR T-SORROW.

Elsewhere you will not find such rest.

Had you not left your cell,

Had you not heard a whisper from the gossip of the
world,

You would have been more restful ;

But if you love now and again to hear the talk of men,

Your heart will have to bear its stormy hour.

CHAPTER XXI⁴

Heart-Sorrow.

F you would do any good,
Keep in the sear of God;

And do not wish to be too free,
But discipline your feelingS‚ hold thern down,
And do not give yourself to silly mirth.
Give yourself over to beart-sorrow,
And you will find devotion there.
Sorrow is the key to many a blessing,
Which a divided heart will soon destroy.

Is it not strange,
That man can ever in this life be wholly happy,

If he but ponders on his exiled state,

And muses on the many perils to his soul'?

But we are so light of heart,

We think so little of our own shortcomings‚

That we feel not the sorrows of the soul,

But, when we really ought to weep,

Then comes the empty laugh.

No liberty is real,

And no joy is true,

Save in the fear of God and in a consciousness of right.
