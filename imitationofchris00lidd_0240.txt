208 OUR REST MUST BE IN GOD.

sept. 11. Let my sighing move Thee, and my varied desolation
upon earth.
Jesus, the splendour of eternal glory,
The comfort of the wandering soul,
My mouth is voiceless before Thee,
My silence speaks to Thee.
How long delays my Lord His coming ἲ
Let Him come to me, poor weakling,
And let Him make me glad,
Putting His hand out,
Snatching a wretch from every trouble.
Come, oh come,
For without Thee no day, no hour is happy.

Thou art my joy,
And without Thee my table empty lies.
1 arn poor and in a way imprisoned, and bound down by

fetters
Until Thou refresh me with the light that shines from

Thee, and givest me the gift of liberty,
Showing me Thy friendly face.
Others may seek instead of Thee
Whate'er they wi11;

Me, till 1 die, nothing can please,
Save Thee, my God, my hope,
Eternal safety.

I will not keep silence,

Ι will not cease to pray to Thee
Until Thy grace return to me,
And Thou speakest in my soul.

11.
(In answer to tlte prayer jesus apsears and speaks.)

Sept. 12· See, Ι am here.
1 come to you,
