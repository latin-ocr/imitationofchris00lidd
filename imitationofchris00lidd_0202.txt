170 THE LOVE OF GOD.

These feel the meaning of the Spirit of truth
That speaks in them,

Because it teaches them to scorn the things of earth,
And love the things above ;

To set the world at naught,

And ever day and night to long for heaven.

CHAPTER V.

T [τε Wondrous Workz‘ng of tlze Love of God.

ATHER of heaven, I bless Thee,
Father of Jesus Christ, my Lord,

That Thou hast deigned to think of me in poverty.
Father of mercies, God of consolation,
Thanks be to Thee,
Who, now and then, with Thy consoling words
Refreshest me, unworthy of all comfort.
I bless Thee always, and I give Thee glory
With Thine own Son, the One—begotten,
And with the Holy Ghost the Comforter,
World without end.
Ah, my Lord God, my holy Lover,
When Thou comest to my heart
All my inward life is glad.
Thou art my glory,
Thou art He that maketh glad my soul,
My help, my haven,
When I am in trouble.

But since Ι am so weak in love, and of imperfect
character,
1 need to be consoled and spoken kindly to by Thee.

Therefore come often to me,
Instruct me in Thy holy rules,
