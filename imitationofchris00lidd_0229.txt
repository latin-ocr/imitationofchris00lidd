GOD ALONE. 197

Wait but a little while, my soul‚
Wait for God's promise,
And all the good of heaven in its abundance shall be yours.

If you long too eagerly for what you see, ,
You shall lose the things of heaven and all that lasts for
ever.
Use what is temporal‚
But long for the eternal.

You cannot seed enough on any thing of time;

You were not made to take delight in this.

Though you had all created goods,

You could not be happy and blest;

But in the God Who made them all

Your blessedness and happiness consist;—

Not the blessedness seen and be-praised by foolish lovers
of the world,

But such as Christ’s true faithful ones are waiting for;

Such as the spiritual and clean-hearted people taste now
and then before the time,

Whose life* is in the heaven.

Empty and brief is every human comfort;
Blesscd and true the solace
Got from the truth within.

11.

The pious soul takes Jesus, his consoler, everywhere
with him,
And says to Him,
‘⁸ Be with me, Lord Jesus, in every place and time.
This shall my comfort be,

To be content to free myself from every human consolation 3
