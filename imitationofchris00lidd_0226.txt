194 HOW WE SHOULD STAND.

The world, the whole world cannot raise him
VVhom Truth has bowed unto herself.

Unshaken by the praise from all men’s lips is he,
If his hope be rooted firm in God.

The very lips that speak,

See, they are nothing, all of them ;

For they shall fade even as the voices fade,

But God’s truth lasts for aye.

CHAPTER XV.

How we should Stand, wlzat we should Say, when
we W ish Anyllzing.

Aug. 23. Y son, GOd·

Say this in everything:
‘⁶ Lord, if it be Thy will,
Let it be so.
Lord, if it be Thy glory,

So be it in Thy name.

Lord, if Thou seest it is well for me,
Approvest it as useful,

Then give it me to use it for Thine honour.
But if Thou knowest it harmful,

And of no profit to the smil,

Then take from me the longing.’'

Not every wish is os the Holy Spirit,
Good though it seem to man, and right.
‘'Tis hard to tell in truth
Whether a good or a strange spirit
Drives you to long for this or that,

Or your own spirit leads you on.
