56 JUDGMENT AND PUNISHMENT OF SJN.

A conscience fine and good shall make a man more glad

Than studicd learning deep.

Then shall the scorn of wealth weigh heavier in the scale

Than all the treasures of the sons of men.

Then you shall get more comfort from your holy prayers

Than from your dainty fare.

Then you shall be far more joyful for the silence you have
kept

Than for long tattling tales.

Then shall your holy deeds be worth

More than your lovely words.

Then shall your penance stern and rule of life delight you

More than all the pleasures of the earth.

So train yourself in little things to suffer.
That in the day to come you may be freed from heavier
woe.
Try first on earth
What you can do hereafter.

If now you can endure so little,
How will you bear a torture that must last for ever?
If now the little suffering makes you so impatient,
What will gehenna make you then ’.Ρ
Behold the truth—the two you cannot have,
Here in the world to pass delightful days,
And afterwards to reign a king with Christ.
And had you lived even till to-day in power and pleasure,
What would it all have done for you,
1f in this instant 'twas your doom to die?

SO, all is vanity
Save loving God and serving Him alone;

For he who loves his God with all his heart
Fears neither death nor punishment,
