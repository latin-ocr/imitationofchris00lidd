224 HELP DIVINE.

That thou mightest be made glorious,

When I am really humbled and made free by Thee.
Be pleased, O God‚ to drag me forth;

For I am poor; what can I do ?

VVhere go, apart from Thee P

Give patience, Lord,

For this one time.

Help me, my God‚

And then Ι shall not fear, however great the burden.

Oct. 5· And now in this what can I say ’ἓ
“ Lord, if it be Thy will.''
Ι have deserved the trouble and the burden,
I must bear them—-

O for patience—-
Until the storm pass and the day be better.
For Thine almighty hand can take even this trial from me,

Lessening its force, so that I yield not quite,
As Thou hast often done before with me,
My God‚ my pitiful One.

And the harder ’tis to me,

The easier 'tis to Thee—
This changing of the hand of the most High.*

Y ῗοζιῖἑῑ the Lord that comforts you in time of tria1;

Come unto Me,
When it is not well with you.

* That is, from sending sorrow to sending joy.
