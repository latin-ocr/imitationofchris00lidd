54 JUDGMENT AND PUNJSHMENT OF SJN.

Better it is upon the earth to purge our sins,
And cut away our faults,

Than if we keep them to be purged in days to corne.
In truth we cheat ourselves

By our unending love unto the ssesh.

What else shall be the fuel of that fire

If it be not your sins?

The more you spare yourself in life,

The more you follow in the body’s steps,

The harder will the reckoning be,

The more the food you keep to seed that blazing ssame.

11.

The sins wherein the man has sinned,
In them shall he be punished with the greater pain;
For there the lazy shall be driven with burning goads,
There the greedy shall be tortured with a thirst and hunger

infinite,

There the wauton and the lovers of delightsome things
In burning piteh and in foul brimstone shall be bathed;
And like mad dogs
The envious men shall howl for grief.
No sin,
T hat shall not meet its own peculiar torment.
There shall the proud
Be covered with the blushes of confusion.
There the miser

Shall with most miserable poverty be settered.

And there one hour shall in its punishment far heavier be
Than fivescore years on earth
In strictest penance spent.
On earth from time to time
There is a rest from toll,
