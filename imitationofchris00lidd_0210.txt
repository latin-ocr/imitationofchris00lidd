178 HIDE POWER BENEATH HUMBLENESS.

And do not leave yourself alone, because your mind is
anxious or your soul disturbed‚

Τ his is what progress means.

Many there are

VVho, when it goes not well with them,

Forthwith are lazy and impatient ;

For a man's path lies not always in his power.

But it is God's to come and comfort when He will,
And how He will, and whom He will,

As His good pleasure is—no more.

Some careless men have quite destroyed themselves

about this power of prayer;

They wished to do more than they could,

Weighing not the measure of their littleness.

Following the longing of the heart,

And not the judgment of the reason,

They took more on them than was pleasant unto God.

So they soon lost it.

They became poor and were left miserable,

They that had built a nest in heaven ;

To learn, impoverished and humbled,

Not to fly with their own wings,

But under Mine to rest and hope.

They that as yet are new, and unskilled in the way of
God,

Unless they rule themselves by the words of the discreet‚
Soon may be deceived and hurt;

But if they wish to follow their own paths,

Their going out will be a road of peril,

If they resuse to be brought back from their own thoughts-
Rarcly do men wise in their own esteem '
