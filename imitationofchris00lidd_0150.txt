120 MANV GOOD THJNG'S ΑΗΕ GJVEN.

And with a new grace Thou dost cheer and lighten them
within ;

That those who felt themselves before communion

Anxious, and loveless towards Thee,

Refreshed with food and drink divine,

Find themselves changed to better men.

Therefore Thou dealest with Thy chosen, arranging well
for them,
That they may truly know and clearly prove the weakness
in themselveS,
The goodness and the kindness gained from Thee.
Cold in themselves, hard, wanting in devotion,

The fervour, eagerness, and holy thoughts all come from
Thee.

For who can come near to a stream of sweetness

And not bring back some taste of sweetness too ?

Or who can stand before a blazing fire

And feel no touch of heat ’.Ρ

T hou art a fountain full and overssowing,

Thou art a fire that always burns,

Never cooling‚ never dry.

And if Ι may not drink my fill and satisfy my thirst,

Yet will Ι put my mouth unto the opening of the heavenly
reed,*

That 1 may get never so small a droplet to take away my
thirst,

And that 1 may not wholly wither.

And if Ι cannot. be as yet all heavenly, assame like cheru-
bim and seraphim,

Yet Ι will try to press on in devotion, and prepare my
heart,

“ Church of Our Fathers,'' for illustrations.
