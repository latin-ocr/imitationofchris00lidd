EXAMPLES SET US BYHOLY FATHERS. 33

They walked in patience and in charity,

And therefore every day they profited upon the spiritual
road,

And gained great grace with God.

They have been given for a guide to all monastic life,
And rather should we follow them to good,

Than let the army of the weak make us of feeble heart.

Think of the zeal in all monastic life,
When first its holy institution was begun ;
Think of their holy prayers,
And how they rivalled one another in the goodness of their
lives ;
Think of the discipline that ssourished like a plant ;
Think of the widespread reverence and respect,
Beneath the rule of those set over them.
The traces of their footsteps left behind them
Yet witness to these holy men,

That fought so stout a fight and trampled on the passing
world.

Yet now we deem him great
Who does not break the monastery fule,
And can with patience bear
The yoke he took upon himself.
Woe to our lukewarm ways, and woe to our neglect ”
That we so soon cool down from our first zeal;
That, tired and chill,

We are even weary of our lives.

You who have seen many a pattern set by pious lives,
O that you may not wholly slumber in your wish
To walk upon the better path.
