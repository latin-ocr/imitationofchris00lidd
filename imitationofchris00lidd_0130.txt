100 ROYAL PATHWAY OF THE HOLY CROSS.

Nothing is dearer unto God,

Nothing more wholesome in this life,

Than willing suffering for Christ.

And if you had to make your choice,

You should choose rather woe for Christ

Than the refreshment that many comforts bring;

For you would be· nearer Him‚

More like to all the saints.

Our merit and our onward way lie not in comfort nor in
much delight,

But rather in great troubles and in suffering many a care.

If there were anything for human safety better, more

useful than enduranee,

Christ would have shown it in His words and life,

For He cheers on His followers in plain words,

And all who would come after Him‚

To bear the Cross, and says,

“ If any would come after Me,

Let him deny himself,

And take his cross and follow Me.”

Read then and scrutinise all that has been written,

But let this be the end ;

*Ε”οῑ “through many tribulations

We must enter to the kingdom of our God.”
