80 LOVE OF JESUS ABOVE ALL.

Nor will He let you die at last.

One day you will have to part from all.
Willing or no;

But hold to Him in life and death,

And trust yourself unto His faithful care,
Who alone can help you when all others fail.
Such is your loved one,

That He will not take what is another's,
But He will have your heart alone,
Seated on His own throne like a king;
And He would willingly dwell with you
If you could only free yourself

From all things that are made.

111.

The saith you put in man, apart from Him,
You will find it nearly all lost work.
Lean not, trust not to the wind-swept reed ;
“All ssesh is grass,

And all its glory like the flower of grass will saul·

You will be soon deceived,
Looking so fixedly upon the outward form of man,
For if you seek your stay, your gain, in others,
Osten, often will you feel but loss.
If in all you look to Him,
Of a surety you will find Him.
If you look but for yourself,
Then you shall find—yourself,
To your own ruin.
For men not seeking Jesus
Do themselves more harm,
Than all the world and all their foes can do.
