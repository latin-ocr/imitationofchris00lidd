192 GOD’S SECRET JUDGMENTS.

When men upbraid you,—

You that so often have offended God,

And many times deserved a hell ’Β

But Mine eye spared you,

Your soul was precious in My sight,

That you might learn My love and live to thank Me sor
My kindnesses,

Giving yourself up freely

Unto true service and a humble life,

And bearing patiently your load of scorn.

CHAPTER XIV.

T lzouglzts on God’s Secretsudgments, tlzat we Boast
Not in Any Good.

The Soul.

HOU thunderest judgments on me, O my Lord,
With sear and dread Thou shakest all my bones.
My soul is terrified indeed,
I stand in dumb amazement, and bethink me
That in Thy sight the heavens are not clean.
If in the angels Thou didst find out wickedness,
And didst sparethem not,
How shall it be with me ἶν’
Stars fell from heaven,
And how can Ι, that am but dust, presume'?
I have seen men whose deeds seemed full of praise
Fau to the lowest depths;
I have seen men that ate the food of angels
Pleased with the husks of swine.

Therefore holiness is none,
If Thou, O Lord, drawest Thy hand away.
