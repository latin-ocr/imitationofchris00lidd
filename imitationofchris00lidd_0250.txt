218 A FREE MIND.

But justisying Me in all My ways, and praising Me, the
Holy One,

Then you are walking in the true, the upright way;

And hope past all doubt shall be yours,

That you shall see My face again with a wild cry of joy.

Nay, if you come to scorn yourself entirely,

Be sure you shall enjoy abounding peace, as far as it is
possible for those that sojourn on the earth.

CHAPTER XXVI.

a Mz‘nd gained, not by Readz‘ng, but by Humble
Prayer.

NLY a perfect man, O Lord,
Can never let the mind relax from pressing onward
to the things of heaven,
And pass through many cares as if without a care;
Not like a sluggard‚
But by the virtue of the free mind's right,
Cleaving with unchecked affection unto none.

11.

I pray Thee, God most pitiful,
Keep me from this life's cares,
That I be not too much tangled in them ;
From the body‘s many necds,
That Ι be captured not by pleasure 3
From all the stumblings of the soul,
That Ι be not cast down and broken with my trouble;
Ido not mean from all the things which worldly vanity
with all its might goes after,
But from the weighty miseries,
