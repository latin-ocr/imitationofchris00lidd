SELF-LOVE. 221

Sept 30⁵ If you seek this or that,

And would be here or there, as suits your own advantage
and your own good will,

You will never be at rest,

Nor free from anxious care.

Because in everything some ssaw will come,

And everywhere some one will rise against you.

It helps you not to gain and multiply your outward
treasures;
Scorn them, uproot them from the heart, and cut them off,
Not only money-gathering do I mean, and wealth,
But honour and the love of empty praise.
As the world passes, they pass too.

Place protects you little
If the spirit of fervour is not there ;
The rest you look for at your doors will not last long,
If the heart has no true foundation,
I mean, in Me.
Change yourself you may;
Better yourself you will not;
For if the chance come and you grasp it,*
You will find what you ssed [rom—ay, and more.

A Prayer to Purge the Heart: a Prayerfor H'eavengy
W’z'sdom.

0⁶!- 1· Strengthen me, God, by Thy Holy Spirit's grace,

Grant that my virtue may be stablished in the inner man,
or my heart freed from every useless care and
grief,

Not drawn away with many a desire of aught—be it cheap
or preclous ;

'⁸‘ That is, temptation.
