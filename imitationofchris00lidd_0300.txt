268 IN THE HANDS OF GOD. -

But all you want shall there be present to you,
And shall resresh your longings and fill them to the full.

There will 1 give you glory for the scorn you suffered,
A cloak of praise for sorrow,

And for the lowest room a kingly seat for evermore.
There shall the fruit of an obedient life appear;

The toiling penitent shall then rejoice, ’

The lowly subject shall be gloriously crowned.

Bend then beneath the hands of all,

And let it be no care to you who speaks or who commands.

But greatly care for this,

That, be it prelate‚ junior, or equal who asks a thing from
you by word ·or sign,

Take it all for good,

Try to fulfil it with real will.

One may seek this, one that 3

One may boast here, another there,

And you may hear him praised a thousand thousand times.

Not in this—not in that—take your delight,

But in scorn of self,

And in what pleases Me and honours Me alone.

This be your wish,

That God be always glorified in you, whether by life or
death.

CHAPTER L.

How desolate Man should put Himself into the
Hands of God.

The Soul.

Nov. 25· LORD GOD, holy Father, now and for ever blessed,
Because Thy will is done,
And what Thou doest is good,
