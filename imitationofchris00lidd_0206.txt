174 THE PROOF OF A TRUE LOVER.

A lover should embrace all that is hard and bitter
For the sake of Him he loves,

And not be turned away from love
For any crosses that may come.

CHAPTER VI.

T [τε Proof of a T rue Lover.
God.

Jugy 25· Y son, you are not brave as yet,
No prudent lover.

The Soul.
Why, O Lord ’Β

God.
Because for little opposition
You leave off what you have begun,
And are too eager after comfort.
One that is brave stands firm in time of trial,

Trusts not the deep persuasion of the enemy.
As Ι please him when things go well,

I grieve him not when all is ill.

The prudent lover does not think so much
About the lover's gift,

As of the giver's love.

Not to the value does he turn, but to the loving thought,
And above all the gifts he puts the loved one.

My noble lover rests not in My gifts,

But, above every gift—in Me.

All is not therefore lost

1f now and then you feel less kindly than you would
To Me or to My saints ;
