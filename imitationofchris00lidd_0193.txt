TRUTH SPEAKS WITHIN US.

In olden days the sons of Israel said to Moses.
“Speak thou to us and we will hear.
Let not God speak to us,
Lest perchance we die.”
Not thus, not thus, 1 pray,
But, with the prophet Samuel,
Humbly, longingly Ι cry,
‘⁴ Speak‚ Lord ; Thy servant hearcth.”

11.

Let not Moses nor a prophet speak to me,
But rather Thou, my God,
That didst send light and spirit on them all3
For Th'ou alone without their help canst fill me fully;
They, without Thee, are nothing worth„
They may sound out the words ;
The spirit they cannot give.
Fair is their speech ;
No heart is set assame, if Thou art silent.
They hand the books to us;
Thou openest the meaning.
They put the mysteries before us ;
Thine is the key to what is sealed.
They utter the commandmentsg
Thou helpest us to keep them.
They point the way;
Thou givest strength unto the journey.
They only deal with us without;
Thou art the guide and lantern for men’s hearts.
They pour on us the water from above 3
Thou givest us the increase.
They cry aloud;
Thou givest understanding to our ears.
