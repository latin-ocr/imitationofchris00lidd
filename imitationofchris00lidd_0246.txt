214 FOUR THJNGS THAT BRING PEACE.

111.
A Prayer for Lzssglzt to be tlzrown on the Mind.

Lightcn me, good Jesus, with the bright light within,
And srom my heart’s cell drive away all shadows.
Bridle my many wandering thoughts ;

Fight bravely for me, conquer the evil beasts—
Enticing lusts, Ι mean,

That in Thy strength there may be peace,

And that Thy praise may evermore resound
Within Thy holy temple-

A conscience that is pure.

Sway the wind, the storm‚

Say to the sea, ‘⁴ Be still;

Breathe not, wind of the north,”

And there shall be great calm.

Send out Thy light of truth, and shine upon the world.
1' am the world, empty and void,
Till Thy light shine on me.
Pour down Thy grace on me,
Pour on my heart the dew of heaven,
Serve me with streams of piety,
Like channels cut upon earth's face,
To bring the good, the perfect fruit, to birth.
Raise high my mind sunk ’neath the weight of sin,
Fasten all my longings in the heaven,
That tasting of the sweetness of delight from there,
I may be slow to muse upon the things of earth.

seim, snatch me from all fleeting creature-comfort3
For no created thing can give me all I want, quiet or
comfort me.
Join me to Thee in the firm hond of love ;
Thou art alone enough for him that loves Thee
The universe apart from Thee is but a sorry thing.
