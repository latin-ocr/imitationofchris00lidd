HOW FEW THE LOVERS OF THE CROSS. 91

CHAPTER XI.
How Few tlte Lovers of tlze Cross ofsesus are.

ESUS has many a one who loves His heavenly
J kingdom,
But few that bear the burden of His Cross
Many that sigh for comfort,
Few that care for trouble ;
Many He finds to shale His table,
Few to join His fast;
All love rejoicing in His company,
Few will bear anything for Him ;
Many will follow to the breaking of the bread,
Few to the drinking of His bitter cup3
Many revere His miracles,
Few come to the disgraceful Cross;
Many love Him
Till they meet adversity;
Many praise and bless Him
While they receive some of His comfort3
But if He hides Himself
And leaves them for awhile,
They fall to weeping or to great despair.

But they who would have Jesus for Himself, and not for

some consoling power that goes along with Him,

In all their trials and heart-agonies they bless Him, just
as when the height of consolation comes.

And if He never would console them,

Yet they would always praise Him,

And ever give Him thanks.

How powerful His pure affection is

Unmingled with sels-interest or sels-love.
