92 HOW FEW THE LOVERS OF THE CROSS.

Those that are always looking out sor comforts,
Must we not call them hirelings ’.Ρ
Are they not rather lovers of themselves,

And not of Christ,
Ever thinking of their own advantage and their gain ’Β

WVhere shall such a man be found
Who will serve God for nothing Ῥ
Rarely is one found so following the spirit
As to live bare of everything ;
For who can find the truly poor in spirit,
Stripped of all created things ’.Ρ
As of a thing that comes from far, from very distant lands,
So would his value be.

If a man give all his wealth,
Yet it is nothing;
And if he make great penances,
Yet it is little;
And if he gain all knowledge,
Yet is he far away ;
And if he have great worth,
And a devotion very bright,
Yet he wants much.
One thing he needs assuredly above all others;
And what ?
To forsake all and leave himself,
To go out wholly from himself,
And to retain no love for any one.
When all is done
That he knows well he ought to do,
He then should feel he has done nothing ς
Nor should it go for much
