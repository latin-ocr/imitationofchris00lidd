GOD ONLY. 297

“ Unless ye be converted and become as little children,
Ye shall not enter there.

Whoever therefore humbles self as does a little child,
He is the greater in the kingdom of heaven.''

Woe unto those who scorn freely to lower themselves
with little children;
The low door of the heavenly kingdom will not let them in.
Ay, and woe unto the rich
Who get their comfort here ;
For, when the poor go through the gam,
They shall stand without and wail.

Rejoice, ye humble,
And exult, ye poor;
God’s kingdom yours,
If ye but walk in truth.

CHAPTER LIX.

All Hope, all T rust, is to be fixed Alone on God.

HAT is the trust, O Lord, Ι have in life,

Or what my greatest-comfort in all I see beneath
the sky ?

Is it not Thou, Lord God,

Whose mercy none can tell ¹?

Where was it well with me apart from Thee‚
Or when could it be ill when Thou art near ’.Ρ
Rather would Ι be poor for Thee,

Thau rich without Thee.

I choose to wander with Thee on the earth,
Rather than gain heaven without Thee.
Where Thou art is heaven,

And, where Thou art not,
Death and hell.
