HIDE POWER BENEATH HUMBLENESS. 179

Lct themselves be humbly ruled by others.

Better i‘. is to taste but little,

And that with humbleness and little understanding,
Than to 'nave stores of sciences and vain conceit.
Better have less than much

To puff you up with pride.

ι. He acts not wisely

That gives himself quite up to joy,

Unmindful os his want in early days and of the pure fear
of God ’

Which is afraid to lose the grace that has been given.

Nor is his wisdom strong enough,

Who in the time of trouble or in heaviness

Carries himself too desperately,

And thinks and feels less trustsully of Me

Than he is bound to do.

He that is too secure in time of peace

Will oft be found too timid and too fearful in the days
of war.

Could you be always humble and modest,

And rule and bridle in your spirit well,

You would not fall so soon a prey to danger and offence.

’Tis a good counsel,
That when the spirit of fervour is conceived‚
You should think how it will be with you when the light is
gone,
And when this comes,
Bethink you that the light may yet return.
l have withdrawn it for a time
To warn you and to glorify Myself.
Probation such as this is better far
Than if you always had your will in prosperous days.
