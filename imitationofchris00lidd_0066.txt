40 LOVE OF SOLITUDE AND SILENCE.

No one deserves comfort from heaven
Unless he diligently practises a holy sorrow for his sin.
Then if you would be sorry in your heart,
In with you to your cell ;
Bar out the tumult of the world:
As it is written,
‘⁴ At your bedside bemoan your sin.’'

And there shall meet you in your cell

What you will often lose outside its walls.

Your cell, if you are often there, grows sweet to you ;

If you but rarely stay, it makes you loathe it.

If when at first you turn to God you do but live within
your cell and keep to it,

Soon shall it be to you a darling mistress,

Loveliest solace of your life.

'Tis in the silent quiet hour the pious soul steps forward
on its path,

Learning the secrets of the written Word of God,

Finding tears in rivers night by night,

Wherewith to wash itself to purity,

Wherein to get the closer to its Maker, ·

As it gets farther off from all the bustle of the ages.

If man but weans himself from friends and those he know&

God and His holy angels will draw near.

Better to live a hidden life
And to take thought about oneself,
Than to work miracles and leave oneself untended.
To go abroad but now and then,
To shun publicity,-—-
Ay, even not to wish to see the face of man,
All this is to be praised in one who takes the vows
