148 - THE POWER TO PRAY.

Nothing will taste so sweet, nothing will please so much,
As the good pleasure of His will.

VVhoever then has raised his motive with single heart up
to his God,
And freed himself from all ill-ordered love,
Or from dislike of aught in the created world,*
He is the fittest to receive the power,
And worthy of the gift of prayer.
God gives His blessing,
When He finds an empty vessel;
And the more perfectly a man renounces what is low,
And dies unto himself through sheer sels-scorn,
The quicker comes the power,
Entering in fuller force,
Lifting the freed heart up.

June 27. ‘⁴ Then shall he see and haste to it,
His heart shall marvel and expand in him,'’
Because God’s power is with him,
And he has placed himself within the hollow of His hand

for ever.

Lo, thus shall he be blest
Who seeks his God with all his heart,
“And hath not lifted up his soul to vanity.”
He, when he takes the holy eucharist,
WVins this great favour—he is one with God,
Because he looks not on his own good thoughts,
Nor on the comfort to his soul.
Above those thoughts, above the words of peace,
He sees the glory and the honour of his God,

'¹‘ He means that the world is outside our dislikc or our
love.
