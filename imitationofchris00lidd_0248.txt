216 TRUE PEACE OF HEART.

To list the veil from hidden things,
If you would caresully wait sor My coming,

Opening the gate that leads me to your nean,
Be prudent;

Watch and pray ;
Be lowly in everything.

CHAPTER XXV.

‘In leom T rue Peace of Heart exists, and Real
ProgreSS.

Sept, 23- NI Y son, Jesus.
I said, “ My peace I leave you,

My peace I give to you.

Not as the world giveth give Ι unto you.'’

All long for peace,

But all care not for what really belongs to it.

My peace is with the humble and the kind in heart,
Yours shall be in great patience.

If you hear Me and follow where you hear,

You will enjoy deep peace.

The Soul.
What must 1 do then ’.Ρ

Jesus.

In everything look to yourself ; see what you do or say,
And let every motive aim at this,
To please Me only;
Apart from Me wish nothing, ask for nothing;
Pass no rash judgments on your neighbours’ words and
deeds,

And tangle not yourself in what does not belong to you.
