Bow down to God‚ humble your sense before your faith,
And light of knowledge shall be given you, so far as it is
good or needsul for you.

Some are greatly tempted over the sacraments and saith.

Yet this is not to be put down to them, but rather to the
enemy.

Take you no care,

Dispute not with your musing thoughts,

And give no answer to the doubts hurled at you by the
devil;

But trust the words of God‚ and trust His saints and
prophets,

And the wicked enemy shall ssee away.

Often it does God’s servants good
To have to meet such thoughts.
The enemy attacks not sinners and the faithless ;
Them he has securely in his power;
But pious souls he tries and vexes many ways.
Then go upon your road with simple trusting saith,
Approach the sacrament with suppliant reverenee;
And, what you cannot understand,
Leave without care to an all-powerful God‚

God cheats you not ;
He cheats himself who trusts himself too much.
God walks with simple men,
Shows Himself to humble men,
Gives to the feeble strength,
Opens His meaning to the pure in mind,
And hides His face from the inquisitive and proud ;
For human reason is but weak, and it may fail ;
But true faith cannot fail.
