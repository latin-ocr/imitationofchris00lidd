GOOD TO COMMUNICATE OFTEN. 117

And make myself a sharer in so great a favour.

For this is one chief comfort of the faithful soul, long as it
wanders from Thee in its mortal frame,

Ever to be mindful of its God‚

Ever with mind devout to take its loved one in.

11.

O strange the condescension of Thy goodness round
about us,

That Thou, the Lord our God‚ creator and life-giver‚ inspirer
of all things that breathe‚

Dost deign to corne to the poor little soul,

Filling the hungry void with all Thy Godhead and Thy
manhood.

Happy the mind and blest the soul, worthy loyally to take
Thee in, its Lord and God‚

And, in the taking Thee, to be filled full with spiritual
gladness.

How great the Master it receives,

How loved the Guest it leadeth in,

How sweet the Fellow that it welcomes home,

How true the Friend embraced,

How noble and how beautiful

The Spouse it takes into its arms,

To be loved before all its cherished ones, and before all
we long for.

Heaven and earth and all their ornament, silent let them
lie before the face of Thee, my best beloved;

For all the praise and all the honour they possess

Come from Thy condescending gists,

And yet they never reach the beauty of Thy name,

Whose wisdom is untold.
