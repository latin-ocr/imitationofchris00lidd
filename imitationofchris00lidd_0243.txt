THE MANV KINDNESSES OF GOD. 211

But rather look to Thee, and praise Thee sor Thy good-
ness;

Because without regarding men

Thou showerest blessings down on them

So freely‚ fully, willingly.

All comes from Thee,

Therefore in all Thou must be praised.

111.

Thou knowest what is fit for each,
Why one has less, another more ;
Not ours to question this, but Thine,
With Whom each man's deserts are strictly watched.

Wherefore, Lord God, I think it a great blessing

Not to have much which outwardly seems worthy praise
or glory,—as men judge of them ;

So that when man thinks on his poverty and low estate,

He should not be disturbed, weighed down, dejected,

But comforted and very joy ful;

For Thou hast chosen for Thy serv ants and familiar friends

The poor and humble, the rejected of the world.

WVitness Thine apostles,

Whom Thou madest chief of all the earth.

They passed their lives without complaint,

So lowly and so simple,

Free from evil thought and guile,

Glad even to endure contempt for Thee.

All that the world hates they embraced with love.

Naught, therefore, should so make Thy lover glad who
knows Thy goodness to h'im,
As Thy will worked out in him, and the good pleasure of
Thine eternal plan.
This ought to please and comfort him,
