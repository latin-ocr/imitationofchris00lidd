200 CHRJST OUR EXAMPLE.

For from the hour when My star rosest
To its setting on the Cross,

My sufferings lest Me not;

Great was My want of temporal comforts‚
Many the scofss Ι heard about Me,
Confusion and reproach I meekly bore,
Ingratitude for kindnesses,

Blasphemy for My mighty works,

Blame sor My teaching.

The Soul.
O Lord,

Because Thou wast so patient in Thy life,

In this above all doing Thy Father’s will,

Well it is that Ι, poor little sinner, should bear all with
patience, and should serve Thy will,

And carry for my safety, long as Thou dost please, the
burden of decaying life.

For though it feels a heavy weight,

Yet it is made through Thy grace very meritorious ;†

And through Thy pattern, and from the footprints of Thy
saints, it is more bearable and brighter for the
weak.

Far more comforting it is than once beneath the law of old,

When heaven's gate remained shut,

And even the path to heaven seemed not so clear.

Then so few cared to seek the kingdom ;

Nor could those who then were good and ready to be saved

Enter the heavenly city
Before Thy suffering and the debt paid by Thy sacred death.

How great the thanks I am bound to give to Thee,

⁴* Ab hora ortus mei.
† That is, if Christ bore it, men may too.
