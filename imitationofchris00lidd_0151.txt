THE PRIESTHOOD. 121

That 1 may gather some small ssash of holy fire, humbly
taking the creative sacrament.

All that is weak in me,

jesus, my God, my holiest Saviour, Thou of Thy kindness
and Thy grace supply sor me.

Thou, that didst deign to call all to Thee in the words

‘⁴ Come unto Me,

All ye that labour and are heavy laden,

And 1 will give you rest,’'—

I labour‚ and the sweat is on my brow;

Torn with heart-sorrow am Ι,

Laden with sin,

Tossed by temptations‚

Entangled and oppressed with many an evil thought;

And there is none to help me

But Thee, my Saviour, my Lord God.

To Thee I trust myself and all my wealth,

To keep and lead me to eterna] life.

Raise me to the praise and glory of Thy name,

Thou that didst prepare Thy body and Thy blood as meat
and drink sor me.

Be near me, O my saving God,
That, often drawing near unto Thy mystery, the fire of my

devotion may increase.

May 26. WERE you as pure as are the angels, holy as St. John
the Baptist,
Yet you would not be worthy to handle or receive this

sacrament.
