No SAFETY. 237

For unto him that overcometh manna is given,
And to the sluggish one is left deep misery.

11.

If you look for rest in life,
How will you come to the eternal rest?
Set not yourself to win deep peace,
But to be very patient.
Seek true peace in the heavens, not on the earth,
Not among men, nor in the rest of the creation,

But in God alone.

For God‘s love you ought willingly to go through all,
Toil and pain,
Temptation‚ vexing cares, anxieties and needs, weaknesscs,
injuries and evil words, blame and humiliation,
Scorn, confusion, and correction.
These are the aids to virtue,
These prove the neophyte of Christ,
These weave the heavenly wreath.
I will give back eternal pay for your brief toi1;
For the confusion of the hour, unending glory.

111.

Think you you will always have the comfort to the spirit

just as you desire ’.Ρ

My saints did not.

They had many troubles, varied trials,

And often were left desolate ;

But-they kept quiet throughout all,'

Trusting God and not themselves,

Knowing that the sufferings of this present time are not
to be compared unto the glory to be gained in
days to be.
