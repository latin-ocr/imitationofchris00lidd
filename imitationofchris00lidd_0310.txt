278 TWO VJEWS OF LIFE.

CHAPTER LIV.*

lee Life of Man—Lrse touched by God—their
Dfflrent Ways.

God.

M Y son, heed carefully the ways of man s life, and oflife
when touched by God ;

They are quite contrary ; they move so stealthily,
Their working scarce perceived,

Save by a spiritual man whose lantern shines within.
All seek the good.

In all they say, in all they do, men aim at something good,
And by what seems the good many are cheated.

The life of man is cunning: it lures, it suares, it cheats;
ltself is its own end.
Life touched by God walks always on the simple path,
Turns from things that wear an evil sace,
Makes for no false mark,

Does all for God in purity,
ln Whom, as in an end, it rests.

The life of man shuns death, shuns pressure, shuns
defeat,
Would not be second,
Would not pass beneath a yoke.
Life touched by God aims at the humbling of self even to
death,

* Throughout this chapter “natura ’⁹ is taken as the ‘⁴ lise of
man,'' “ gratia '' as ‘⁴ life touched by God.” This seems to bring
the sense out better than the unmeaning theological transliter-
ation os “nature ” and ‘⁴ grace.'’
