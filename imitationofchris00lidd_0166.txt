136 WHAT IS NEEDED.

Save Thee, its only loved one,

Longed for past all the longings of its heart.

Sweet were it for me when Thou art there to pour a ssood
of tears out from my inward love,

And with holy Magdalene to wash Thy feet.

But where is this devotion to be found ’.Ρ

Where is the flowing river of the holy tears?

June 13. Ι know that when Ι see Thee

And Thy holy angels,

All my heart should burn and weep for joy.

For, hidden though Thou art beneath another form,
I have Thee with me truly in the sacrament.

VVere Ι to see Thee in Thy own, Thy heavenly brightness‚
My eyes could not endure it,

s Nor could the whole world stand

In the splendour of the glory of Thy majesty.
Therefore Thou carest for my weakness even in this,
That Thou dost hide Thyself beneath the sacrament.
1 have, Ι worship,

What angels worship in the sky,

But I as yet in saith,

They in its unveiled beauty.

The light of true saith must content me on my path,
Until the day of everlasting sunlight breathe on us,
And shapes and shadoxvs fade*

But when that which is perfect comes,
The need of sacraments shall cease.
The blessed ones in heavenly glory
Need no healing sacrament.

Rejoicing endlessly in sight of God,
Gazing on His glory face to face,

* Donec adspiret dics aeternae claritatis
Et umbrae figurarum inclinentur. Cf. Cant. ii. 16.
