DUTIES OF A GOOD MAN. 35

The plans of good men rest more on God's touch than on
any wisdom of their own,

In Him they always trust.

For man lays plans,

God scatters them ;

Man’s purpose is not His.

If out of pity, or to do a brother good,
We sometimes leave one of our practices,

Some other time we can with ease recover what is gone.

But if we lightly let it go for weariness or carelessness,
Then it is very wrong,

And we shall feel the harm.

Much as we try,

We yet shall soon give way in many a thing ;

But we should always lay a certain plan before us,

And most of all against those things that stop us in our
way.

11.

Our outer and our inner life must both be closely
watched and ordered,
For both are useful to us on our path.

1f you cannot always bring your thoughts to one,
Sometimes at all events you may ;
Say once a day at least,
At morning or at eventide.
At morning lay your plans,
At eventide search through your ways,—
What you have said this day,
What done, what thought ;
For more than once you may have sinned
Against your neighbour and your God.
