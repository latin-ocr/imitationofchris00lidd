260 ANV TROUBLES MUST BE BORNE.

You shall not cry, ‘⁴ Ah, my stay here is so long.”
For death shall be thrown down;

There shall be health that cannot fail,

No troubles,

Blessed joy,

Sweet‚ comely company.

11.

O, had you seen the everlasting wreaths worn by the

saints in heaven,

How gloriously·they shout for joy,

Who once were here thought scorn of, and as it were
unworthy of life,

You would, Ι know, bow to the earth,

And rather try to be below the rest, than to be lord of one.

You would not lust for joyful days in life,

But would be rather glad to suffer for God,

And think it mighty gain to pass for nothing among men.
If all this touched you and went deeply to your heart,
How would you dare (nce to complain ’.Ρ

Are not all toilsome things worth bearing for eternal life ’.Ρ
It is no little thing

To win or lose God's kingdom.

Then list your eyes on high,
See,
I and my saints with Me,
Who in this world have had great strife.
Now they are glad,
Now they are comforted,
Now they are safe at rest,
And sor ever in My Pather’ s kingdom shall abide with Me.
