ROYAL PATHWAY OF THE HOLY CROSS. 95

Nor surer road below,
Than in the pathway of the Holy Cross.

Arrange and order everything to suit your will, to suit

the pleasure of the eye,

And you will always find—a cross ς

For either in your body you will meet with pain,

Or in your soul will have to bear trouble of spirit.

Now and again God leaves you ;

Now and again your nearest friend will anger you ;

And more-——you will be grievous to yourself;

And you will not be able to be quit of it,

Or make it lighter

By any remedy or solace,

So long as God wills you to bear it.

His pleasure is that you should learn to suffer care un-
comforted,

Wholly subjecting you to Him,

Getting a humbler spirit from your trials.

Christ’s sufferings are by none so really felt

As by the man who has to bear the like.

April 28. Therefore the Cross is always ready,
And at every turn awaits you.
Run where you please,
You cannot shun it;
For everywhere you take yourself along with you,
And you shall always find yourself;
You shall always find the cross,—-
Above, below, within, without,
Turn where you will.
And you must needs be patient
If you would have peace within
Andsgain the everlasting crown.
