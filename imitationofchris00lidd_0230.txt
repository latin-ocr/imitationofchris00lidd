198 ALL OUR CARE SHOULD REST ΟΝ GOD.

And if Thy comfort fail me,
May Thy will and this just trial of me
Console me more than all.

For thou wilt not be always angry with me,
Nor threaten 'me for ever.''

CHAPTER XVII.
All Οιιν Care should Rest on God.
God.

Y son,
Let Me do with you what I will.
Ι know what is the best for you;
Your thoughts are human thoughts,
Your feelings often follow a human bent.’

The Soul.

Lord‚ what Thou sayest is true;
Thine anxious thought for me is greater far
Than all my care for mine own self could be.
Man stands too dangerously
If he throws not all his care on Thee.

Let but my will remain straight and fixed to Thee,
Do with me what Thou wilt;

For what Thou doest cannot be but good.

If Thou wilt keep me in the darkneSS, blessed be T110u3
Or in the light,

Blessed again be Thou.

If Thou givest consolation,

If Thou sendest tribulation,

None the less, blessed be Thon, blessed be Thou.

'⁸ Tu sentis in multis sicut humanus suadet affectus.
