A STRONG DESJRE. 145

C HAPTER XIV.

A Strong Desz're among some Pt'ous Souls to take
the Body of Christ.

The Voice of the Learner.

OW many Thy sweet ways, O Lord,
That Thou hast hidden away for those that sear
Thee.

When I remember some good souls, O Lord, that come
with such great piety and love unto Thy sacrament,
Ι am confounded in myself and blush
That to Thine altar and Thy holy table of communionI
come so eool-—so cold.
So parched I stay, so far from heart-affection,
I am not all aflame before Thee, O my God,

1 arn not fiercely drawn to Thee‚ nor touched as many pious
souls have been,

Who in their great desire andin the heart-love that they
feel could not restrain themselves from tears.

Body and soul alike‚ to Thee, O God, the living sountain,
from the being’s inmost depths* their lips were
open wide ;

V Nor could they stay, nor stop their hunger

But by the taking of Thy body with pleasant thought and
eagerness of soul.

O, true and burning was their saith,
A proof both clear and strong that Thy holy presence was
within them.

They truly know their Master in the breaking of the bread,
Whose heart so greatly burns within them, because of
Jesus as He walks with them.
