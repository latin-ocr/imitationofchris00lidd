WE ARE NOT WORTHK 273

You will feel weariness and heaviness of heart.

Therefore while in the ssesh you often have to groan over
its burden,

And that you cannot always cleave unto the studies of the
spirit and your thoughts of God.

11.

Then it is better for you to betake yourself to lowly and

to outward works,

And to refresh yourself in doing good,

And, firmly confident, to wait for Me and for the visit from
on high,

Bearing your exile and the desert ofyour mind with patience,

Till you again are visited by Me,

And freed from every care.

For 1 will make you to forget your toils,

And enjoy peace within.

Before you 1 will stretch the meadows of the Scriptures,

That with a swelling heart you may begin to run the way
of My commandments;

And you shall say,
The sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be

compared
With the glory that shall be revealed in us.

CHAPTER LII.

Man should not think H z'mself Worthy of Comfort,
but rather W ortlgy of Blows.

The Soul.

ORD, I am not worthy of Thy comfort,
Nor of any visit from on high;

And thus Thou dealest justly with me, 8
