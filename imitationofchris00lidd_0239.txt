OUR REST MUST BE IN GOD. 207

Sweetest alone, alone most comforting,

Most beautiful, most loving,

Noblest and most glorious;

In Whom all good together is,

Is and ever was and shall be.

And therefore anything Thou givest me, apart from Thee,
It is too little for me, and it satisfies me not ;

And anything Thou showest me of Thee or promisest,
Ι5 not enough, if Thou art still unseen,

And not quite gained by me.

For my heart cannot truly rest, nor wholly be content,
Except it rest in Thee,

Passing all gifts

And all created things.

O my loved sponse, Lord Jesus, my purest lover, lord

of the whole creation’s world,

Who would give me wings of liberty to fly to Thee and be
at peace in Thee ’.Ρ

Ο when shall it be given me to be fully free, and see how
sweet Thou art, O Lord my God ’.Ρ

When to the full Ι gather me to Thee,

And through Thy love lose sense of self,

And feel Thee only, above every sense and limit,

In a manner only known to few.

But now Ι often groan,

And carry my unhappiness in grief,

For much comes on me in this vale of misery, that troubles,
clouds, and saddens me,

Hinders, distracts me,

Entangles me, allures me,

That I cannot with freedom come to Thee,

Enjoying sweet embraces that are ever ready for the spirits
of the blest.
