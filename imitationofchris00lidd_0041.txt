OBEDIENCE AND SUBJECTION. 15

CHAPTER VIII.
Beware of being T 00 Famz'lt'ar.

OU must not take the eovering from your heart for
every one,
But tell your case unto the wise God-[earing man.
Only now and then be with the young or with the people
of the outer world.
When with the rich, refuse to ssatter them,
And do not hurry to appear before the faces of the great.
Make to you friends of the simple and the lowly,
The pious and obedient folk,
And talk of what will build the palace of the soul.
For women—be not intimate with any,
But commend all good women to your God.

11.

Only with God and with His angels long to be intimate,
And shun man’s notice.
Kind you must be towards all,
But intimacy is not good.
Osten we see
How a great name will make some unknown person glitter,
And yet his actual presence throws a shadow on the light
For them that look on him.
Sometimes we think to please another by our company,
But we displease him by the unholy character he sees in us-

CHAPTER IX.

Obedience and Subsectz'on.

URELY it is a great thing to stand and live obedient
Under superiors,
And not to Le a law nuto oneself.
