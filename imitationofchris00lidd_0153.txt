THE PRIESTHOOD. 123

And linked yourself unto a higher ideal of a holy life.

A priest should be adorned with every virtue,

Giving a pattern of good life to all.

His goings are not with the crowd, nor in the common
walks of men,

But with the angels in the heavens,

Or with the perfect on the earth.

A priest in holy vestments clad acts in the place of Christ,
Praying for himself and all, a lowly suppliant to God.
Before him and behind him is the sign of the Lord’s cross,
To bring Christ’s passion ever to his mind;

Before him-on the chasuble,

That he may with·care behold Christ’s footprints;

Behind him—he is signed with it,

That he may bear graciously for God with any troubles
set on him by others.

Before,

That he may mourn for his own sin;

Behind,

That he may weep for others’ sins in pity,

And know that he is there to stand between God and the
sinner;

Never growing dull in prayer, nor in the holy offering,

Till he be found to win God’s pity and His favour.

Thus when he celebrates he honours God,
He makes the angels glad,
He builds the body of the Church,
He helps on those that live,
Gives quiet to the dead,
And wins a share in all things that are good.
