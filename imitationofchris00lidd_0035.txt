TRUTH’S TEACHING. 9

And no deep thoughts of ours are free from some dark mists.

The humble knowledge of yourself

Will be a surer road to God

Than a deep searching into knowledge of the world.

Yet knowledge is not to be blamed,

Nor any simple grasping of a thing.

Nay, in itself considered, it is good,

And is of God ordained;

But a good conscience and a virtuous life are ever put
before it.

Still, because many rather strive to know

And not to live in holiness,

They often err,

And bring forth little fruit, if any at all.

O, if they used the care they spend upon their questions,
In rooting out their vices and in sowing seeds of virtue,
There would not be such scandals and such evils in the

world, ,
Such careless ways within the cloister walls.

But, when the day ofjudgment comes, we shall be asked
What we have done,—and not what we have read;
How holy were our lives,-and not how fine our words.

Tell me,
Where now may all those lords and masters be whom you
knew well
While on the earth they lived,
And while they ssourished in their learning?
Their prebends others hold;
Ι cannot tell if they think once of them.
In life it seemed that they were something great,
And now none speaks of them.
How fast, how fast the glory of the world ssits by.
