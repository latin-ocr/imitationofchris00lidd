ΝΟ GOOD IN SELF. 245

When 1 am not helped by Thee and inwardly instructed,
1 become wholly cool and lax.

But Thon, O Lord, art always as Thou wast and ever art,
Good and just and holy‚
Well, justly, and in holy ways performing all;
But I, who readier am to fall away than to go forward,
Never can last in one condition,
‘⁶ For seven times change ovcr me.’'
Still, ‘twill be better soon, when it shall be Thy will,
And Thou hast stretched Thy hand to help me; for Thou
alone canst help without a word from man.
Thou canst strengthen me so much
That my face shall no more turn to different things,
But that to Thee alone my heart shall wheel and be at rest.

Wherefore if I only knew how to cast aside all human
comfort,
Either to gain devotion,
Or for the need that makes me bound to look to Thee
Because there is no man to comfort me,
Then Ι could really hope for something of Thy grace,
Exulting in the gift of a fresh comfort.

11.

Thanks be to Thee, from Whom all comes,
As oft as it goes well with me.

But I am vanity and nothing before Thee,
A man inconstant, weak;
What can I boast of ’.Ρ
Or why seek to be thought much of ’.Ρ
Can anything from nothing comes*
And this nothing very vain ’.Ρ

'¹‘ Numquid de nihilo?
