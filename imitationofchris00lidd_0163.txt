FORBEAR Nor COMMUNJON. 133

Often this hinders men—
Excessive care to get a holy frame of mind,
And an anxiety about confession.
Do as the wise would have you do,
Lay scruple and anxiety aside.
It stops the hand* of God,
It ruins holy thoughts.

You are disturbed or slightly troubled—
Leave not your communion for that,

But go the sooner to confess;
And from your heart

Forgive all others their offences.
But if you have hurt anyoie,
Humbly ask forgiveness,

And God will fully pardon you.

11.

Why delay confession long,
Or why put communion by ’.Ρ
First cleanse yourself‚
Be swift to spit the poison forth,
Hurry to get the remedy;
You will feel better than from long delay.
Suppose you leave it for one cause to-day ;
Perchance to-morroxv something greater will be found.
This way you might be kept long from it,
Becoming more ancl more unfit.
Fast as you can, shake yourself free from to-day's sloth and
’ heaviness.
What is the use of long anxiety, passing whole days in
trouble ’.Ρ
Why rob yourself of heavenly things because you have a

daily cross ’.Ρ
* Gratiam.
