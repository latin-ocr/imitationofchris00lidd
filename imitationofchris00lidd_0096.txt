68 THE HIGHER LIFE WITHJN.

‘⁴ If any love Me he will keep My words,
And we will come to him,

And with him will we make our divelling—placd’

r 22· Room, then, sor Christ,

And to all other entrance be denied.

And, having Him,

Then you are rich : He is enough for you.

'Tis He that will provide for you ;

He will be your faithful steward in all,

That there may be no need to put your hopes ‘11³ men,

For men soon change and quickly fail us,

But Christ stays till eternity,

And stands to help us firmly to the end.

We cannot put much trust in man, weak and doomed to
die-—

Useful and loving though he be,

Nor need we nurse sad thoughts

lf now and then man thwarts us and opposes.

They that to-day are with us,

May, on the morrOW, take another's part,

Shifting often like the changing breeze.

11.

Then put your trust alone in God,
And let Him be your sear, your love.
He will answer men for you,
He will do what shall be best,
And He will do it well.
Here you have no abiding city;
Everywhere you are a stranger and a pilgrim,
Nor will you find your peace,
Save you be inwardly at one with Christ.
Why look you round,
