TRUST IN GOD. 257

You will not heed ten thousand words of man.

Think—if all were said against you that could most
maliciously be feigned,

What would it hurt you ’.Ρ

If you let it all go by,—

Not worth a straw to you, —-

Could it pull even a hair srom you'?

But he who keeps no hold upon his heart. and has not
God before his eyes,
IS lightly moved with words of cursing ;
While he that trusts inssMe, and does not long to stand by
his opinion of himself,
Shall be free from fear of man.
For Ι arn judge of all,
Ι know all secrets,
Ι know how sins are' done,
Ι know the one who does the wrong,
And him that suffers it.
‘⁴ That word ”⁴¹² went forth from Me,
‘¹ That '’ happened and Ι let it go,
That “thoughts in many liearts might be revealed.’'
Ι will judge the guilty and the innocent,
But I wished even before to prove them both by secret tests.
Man’s evidence often misleads‚
The sentence that I pass is true.
It shall stand, and shall not be o’erthrown.
Mostly hidden, it lies clear now and then to few,
Yet it is never wrong, and never can be,
Though it may seem so to the eyes of fools.

To Me then you must come in every judgment.
You must not lean on what you think of it,
For the just man will not be troubled,

* That is, what you are complaining of.
