MEETING TEMPTATJONS. 21

Useful it is for man to suffer contradiction
(Though he does well, means well),
When men think ill of him, or know but half the truth.
These are the guides that lead to lowliness,
That shield him from vainglory;
For then, when outwardly men hold us cheap‚
When they will hear no good of us,
Clearer we look towards God, the inner witness of our deeds.
A man should root himself in God—so fixedly
As not to need consoling words from men.

11

lan. 24. A man (who means to do so well),

When scourged by evil thoughts, harrowed and tried,
Can see more clearly that lze must leave God,
Can grasp that without God he can do nothing good,

Then he is sad, he mouns, he prays,
By reason of his misery.
Weary of longer life,
He sighs for death to come,
To be dissolved and be with Christ.

And then he fully learns
That in the passing world full peace and perfect satety
cannot long abide

CHAPTER XIII.

M eetz'ng Temptatz'ons.

O long as in this world we live,
We cannot be untempted and unscourged ;
Wherefore in Job we read
That life of man upon the earth means trial.
So every man should in his prayers keep watch
