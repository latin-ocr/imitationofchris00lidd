Ο how much, how very much I need Thine inssuence,
Lord,

To start upon a path of good,

To make way in it,

And to end the journey.

Without this inssuence I can do nothing ;
But when it strengthens me I can do all.

Ο kindly influence, truly heavenly,

Apart from which we have no merits of our own,

Apart from which before Thee, Lord, no natural gifts have
any weight,

Arts are nothing, riches nothing,

Beauty and strength are nothing,

Wit and eloquence are nothing,—

For they are shared by good and bad alike,—-

But the gracious influence of love is the peculiar gift ot
Thine elect ;

WVearing this mark, they are deemed worthy of eternal
life.

So high it reaches,

That no gift of prophecy, no marvel-working, no deep
discussions, be they what they may, are, without
it, of any value ,—

No, not even saith, nor hope,

Nor any other virtue,

Is, without it and charity, received by The-0.

111.

O thrice blest inssuence of God that makes the poor in
spirit rich in worth,
And makes the rich lord humble in heart,
