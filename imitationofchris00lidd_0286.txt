254 TRUST FEW.

Who can see all beforehand Ῥ
Who can beware of coming woes‘?
If the ills we foresee hurt us,

What can the unforeseen ones do but fiercely strike us'?
But why have I not provided better in my misery ?

Why have I lightly trusted others P
Well, we are men,

Naught but frail men,

Though many think us angels—ay, and call us 50.

Whom may I trust, O Lord,
Whom,

Save Thee ¹?

Thou art the truth,

Deceiving not ;

And not to be deceived.

And again—every man is lying,

W eak, unstable‚

So ready in his words to slip,

That what sounds right, looks right,
Ought scarce to be believed at once.

How wisely hast Thou warned us to beware of men,
That a man's foes are his own household,
And that we must not listen when they say, ⁴‘ See, He is
here; see, He is there.''
I have learned the lesson to my loss ;

Would that it led me on to greater care, and not to
folly.

“ Take care,’' one says, ‘⁴ take care,
Keep what Ι tell you to yourself; ''

And, while 1 hold my tongue and think the secret kept,
He cannot keep what he asked me to keep,
Betrays himsoelf and me,——and off he goes.
