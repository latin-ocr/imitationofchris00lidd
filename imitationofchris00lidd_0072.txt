46 THOUGHTS ΟΝ THE MISERY OF MAN.

We eat, we drink,
We sleep, we watch,
We rest, we work,

We yield to all the other debts that nature makes us pay.
All this is misery and sorrow to the pious soul,

Who longs to be quite free, untrammelled by a sin.

His inward heart is much disturbed

By all the body’s needs here in the world;

Whence comes the prophet's pious prayer

To be far from them as he may:

‘⁴ Tear me away from my necessities‚ O Lord.''

But woe to them who know not their own misery;
And woe, worse woe to those who love this life,
So wretched, and so ready to decay;
For some hug life to them so close,
That, could they scarcely get enough to eat
By begging or by work,
If they could only live on here for ever,
They would care nothing for God's kingdom.
Fools and faithless in your hearts,

So deeply sunk in earthly things,
That you taste nothing save the ssesh ;
But at the last you wretched men will feel it heavily,

How cheap and worthless are the things that you have
loved.

But saints of God and all the pious friends of Christ
Cared not for al] that pleased the ssesh,
Cared not for all that ssourished in this passing time,
But all their thoughts and all their hopes panted for the
everlasting good,
All their desires were hsted up, high up to what lasts long,
to what men cannot see,
